to permit them to do so or came to a halt.
        There are special steps and handles built into the President's
car at the two rear corners especially so that agents riding the
front running board  of the Presidential follow-up car can ride
there; the President had frequently stated that he did not wish
to have the agents riding on these steps during a motorcade and
had repeated this wish only a few days previously to agents
assigned to him in Tampa. (In Dallas SA Hill, who had been
assigned to Mrs. Kennedy and had not been in Tampa with the
President, occasionally rode on the left rear step. Agent Ready,
who was aware that the president has specifically stated his
objection to agents' riding on the steps, did not ride the
in Dallas.)
    (5)  The Vice Presidential car. This was an open Lincoln
Continental convertible.  It was driven by Hurchel Jacks of the
Texas Highway Patrol, and ASAIC Rufus W. Youngblood rode in the
right front seat. Vice President Johnson occupied the right rear
seat, Mrs. Johnson the center rear seat, and Senator Yarborough
the left rear seat. ASAIC Youngblood was in charge of the Vice
Presidential detail at this time.
      II. NARRATIVE OF EVENTS IN DALLAS ON NOVEMBER 22, 1963
         The Presidential aircraft touched down at Love Field,
Dallas, Texas, at about 11:37 a.m., November 22, 1963.  The
weather was sunny with temperatures in the 70's.  At 11:40 a.m.,
the President came out from the rear exit of his plane and down
the ramp, together with Mrs. Kennedy, Governor and Mrs. Connally
and other members of his party.  ASAIC Kellerman and SA Hill
also came out the rear exit. ATSAIC Roberts and SA's Ready,
Lawton, McIntyre and Greer, came down the front ramp and with
the exception of Greer (the driver of the President's car) ,
promptly joined the others with the President and Mrs. Kennedy.
ASAIC Youngblood, assisted by ATSAIC Johns, and SA's Kivett and
Warren Taylor, took positions in proximity to the Vice
President and Mrs. Johnson.
       The President and Mrs. Kennedy then walked sown a receiving
line, shaking hands with fifteen to twenty persons of the local
committee.  The First Lady was presented with a bouquet of red
roses, and the President with two charcoal drawings in a leather
frame which he handed to SA Landis to hold.  The President and
Mrs. Kennedy then walked over to a lady seated in a wheelchair be-
tween the airplane and the chain link fence where the crowd was
and friendly as the President and Mrs. Kennedy moved along.  At
one point Mrs. Kennedy seemed to fall slightly behind the President
and the agents then made it possible for her to catch up with
her husband.  At one time Mrs. Kennedy turned away from the
fence to proceed to the Presidential car accompanies by the
agents guarding her. but then noticed that the President had
continued down the fence and rejoined him.  At another point
where the fence makes a right angle the President started to
move out to his car but then turned back and resumed the
handshaking for an additional brief interval, All along this
fence were Dallas policemen at frequent intervals, posted
 looking at the crowd, while in the crowd were a number of plain-
clothesmen of the Dallas Police Department.
        The Vice President and Mrs. Johnson also shook hands with
people in the crowd, following the President and Mrs. Kennedy
along the fence.  During this time and throughout the occasion,
they were guarded by four members of the Vice Presidential Detail,
namely: ASAIC Youngblood, ATSAIC Johns, SA Kivett, and SA Warren
Taylor. SA Taylor was detailed on this trip to accompany
Mrs. Johnson.

                                                              to Dallas, Texas, where they were
                                                              scheduled to attend a luncheon and the
                                                              President was to speak.  This luncheon
                                                              was sponsored by the Dallas Citizens
                                                              Council, the Dallas Assembly, and
                                                              the Science Research Center on
                                                              November 22, 1963.


INTRODUCTION


Reference is made to my preliminary survey report dated November 19. 1963.


This survey was conducted by SA Winston Lawson, Office 1-16, and SAIC
Forrest Sorrels, Office 3-3, and assisted by SA David Grant, Office 1-16,
from November 13 through November 22, 1963. SA Jerry Kivett, Office 1-22,
coordinated the Vice President's plans for the visit from November 18
through November 22, 1963.


A large crowd was on hand to greet the Presidential Party at the airport.
The motorcade route was lined by crowds which were quite large, especially
in the downtown area.  The invited guests were awaiting the arrival of
the Presidential Party at the Trade Mart, the site of the luncheon and
speech.


Appropriate attire for this luncheon was a business suit.

                      arrived at Love Field, Dallas, Texas.  (See attached

                      Attachment #2.


                      The President was met by members of the party from
                      AF #2 and the local reception committee.  Mrs. Kennedy,
                      Mrs. Johnson, and Mrs, Connally were presented flowers.
                      (See preliminary report reception committee list.  Mr.
                      George Miner and Mr. David Keeler were deleted.)

                      The President, Mrs. Kennedy, the Vice President and
                      Mrs. Johnson walked along the airport fence shaking
                      hands and greeting the crowd.  The motorcade vehicles
                      were being loaned at this time.  (See Scheduled
                      Motorcade List.)  Attachment #3.


11:55 a.m.     The Presidential Party departed the airport.


12:29 p.m.     Appropriate signal given by SA Lawson from Lead Car that
                      we were approximately five minutes from destination -
                      the Trade Mart.


12:30 p.m.     Because of what appeared to be the sound of a firecracker
(Approx.)       or gunfire, also because of unusual activity in the
                      Presidential and follow-up cars, we immediately accelerated
                      movement of Lead Car. Information was received over the
                      two-way radio that we should proceed to the nearest hospital,
                      and we were escorted speedily to the Parkland Hospital.
                      The President and Governor Cannily were placed on stretchers
                      and were immediately take to the Emergency Room for medical
                      attention.  (See my statement and statements from other
                      agents as to activities during this incident.)


                      Note:  Separate reports containing information on activities
                      at the hospital and subsequent trips of the Vice President
                      and the body of the President to Love Field and their
                      departure for Washington, D. C., will be submitted as soon
                      as practical.


                      Note:  The following is the approximate scheduling of
                      events and itinerary for the remainder of the visit.


12:35 p.m.     Presidential Party should arrive at the Trade Mart, 2100
 (Approx.)      Stemmons Freeway in parking lot on Industrial Boulevard.


Catering for the luncheon was furnished by Crotty Bros., Boston,
Massachusetts, the contract catered for the Trade Mart. They
normally operate the Trade Mart cafeteria on food service. The Presi-
dent's food supply was to come from the general food supply, and the
head table waiters, food preparers, and Crotty Bros. personnel were
listed and names and data sent by SAIC Sorrels, Dallas, to our Protec-
tive Research Section for processing.  Any catering personnel in
proximity to the head table were identified by green lapel clips.


The Dallas Fire Department conducted a safety inspection and had fire-
men deployed in the Trade Mart with protective equipment.  The Dallas
Health Department inspected the kitchen area and facilities.


The general public was not allowed in the parking lot area where the
motorcade would pass and was to stop.  No public vehicles were allowed
to park in the lot.  It was secured by ropes and barricades.  Police
officers were placed on the roof of the Trade Mart, Market Hall, and
Dallas Home Furnishings Mart, as they overlooked the point where the
President would alight from his vehicle.  Police were also utilized for
crowd, traffic, and parking control at the Trade Mart.


Special instructions were sent to lessees of the Trade Mart by W. E.
Cooper, General Manager, Dallas Market Center.  (See attachment #9.)

        On November 22, 1963, I was assigned to drive the Vice President’s car
in Fort Worth, Texas, and was therefore not assigned a post during the Dallas
visit.

        Upon Completion of my assigned duties in Fort Worth, Texas, which occurred
sooner than anticipated, I departed Carswell Air Force Base in Secret Service
car 720-S, and proceeded to Dallas Love Field to assist in the general security
in that area.  I arrived at Dallas Love Field at approximately 12:20 P. M.,
and assisted the local police and Special Agents Warner and Lawton in the
security of Air Force I and II.


        At approximately 12:30 P. M. the crew of Air Force I was alerted to stand
by for immediate departure and this was the first indication I received that
some trouble had occurred with the Presidential visit.  Succeeding information
was obtained at various intervals from the plane crew and over a pocket radio
carried by one of the local police officers.  It was by this means that I
learned the President had been assassinated.


        Upon learning of the President’s death, I assisted SA LAwson and SA Warner
in direction of local police officers in applying strict security to Air Force
I and II and the general landing area and buildings in the vicinity.


        I remained in close proximity of Air Force I during the arrival of Vice
President and Mrs. Johnson, the President’s coffin, and Mrs. Kennedy.  I
stayed in the vicinity of Air Force I until it departed, at which time I return-
ed to the Dallas Field Office.



The President with Mrs. Kennedy and official party arrived at Love
Field, Dallas, Texas, aboard AF #1 (USAF 26000) at 11:40 a.m. (cst).
After the receiving members of the official reception party, the President
and Mrs. Kennedy walked over to a fenced area and shook hands with many
of the people who had gathered there to view their arrival.  At the conclusion
of greeting the gathering, the President, MRs. Kennedy, Governor and Mrs.
Connally entered the presidential limousine (special car: bubble-top, 1961
Lincoln Continental, seven-passenger, four-door convertible sedan).  The
President sat on the right rear seat with Mrs. Kennedy to the left of him.
Governor Connally sat on the right jump seat and Mrs. Connally sat on the
left jump seat.  I rode in the front (right side) and William Greer drove
the vehicle.


In the Secret Service follow-up car, 1956 Cadillac touring sedan (top down),
driven by SA Samuel Kinney, ATSAIC Emory Roberts rode in the right front
seat, SA John Ready stood on the right front running board, SA Paul Landis
on right rear running board, SA Clinton J. Hill on left front running board
and William McIntyre on the left rear running board. SA Glen Bennett rode in
the right rear seat and SA George Hickey on the left rear seat. Mr. Kenneth
O’Donnell and MR. David Powers (White House staff) rode the left and right
jump seats respectively.


Behind the follow-up car was the Vice President’s car with Vice President
and Mrs. Johnson and senator Yarborough in the rear seat. SA Rufus
Youngblood rode in the right front seat and the police officer drove the car.
The following vehicles were four cars of congressional members, press
cars, VIP bus and then press busses.


We departed Love Field at 11:55 a.m., along the planned motorcade route,
enroute to a luncheon at the Trade Mart, given by the Democratic Citizens
Council, scheduled for 12:30 p.m. cst. As the motorcade completed the
main thoroughfare through Dallas, we made a sharp right turn,for about a ½
block, then a curved left turn into a slight downhill grade, entering an area
with little or no spectators. We were still traveling at the normal rate of
speed from 12 to 15 miles per hour when I heard a noise, similar to a
firecracker, exploding in the area to the rear of the car. About 12:30 p.m.


Immediately I heard what I firmly believe was the President’s voice, “My
God, I’m hit!” I turned around to find out what happened when two addi-
tional shots rang out, and the PResident slumped into Mrs. Kennedy’s


lap and Governor Connally fell into MRs. Connally’s lap. I heard Mrs.
Kennedy shout, “What are they doing to you?”


Confidential [stamped, crossed out}
I yelled at William Greer (the driver) to “Step on it, we’re hit!” and grabbed
the mike from the car radio, called to SA Lawson in the police lead car
that we were hit and to get us to a hospital.


With SA Lawson riding in the police car they quickly formed the accompany-
ing escort for the motorcade around our limousines and sped us through the streets...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(58%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic5.html>president mrs governor connally sa kennedy car hospital seat johnson</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(21%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic3.html>left kellerman back white service advised motorcade car area stated</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(5%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic2.html>mr department hubert office chief crull report general city police</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
