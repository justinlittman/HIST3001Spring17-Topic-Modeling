MEMORANDUM FOR THE FILE


      Attached is a list of proposed witnesses, the taking of whose
testimony has been authorized by Mr. Rankin.  Such individuals
have not yet been advised that the Commission is interested in taking
their testimony, although instructions have been given for the
preparation of such letters.  This memorandum will indicate which
of the witnesses clearly must be examined and will set forth the
relevant considerations concerning those witnesses as to which that
requirement is not entirely clear.


                Mrs. Mary E. Bledsoe
                Mr. and Mrs. A. C. Johnson
                Mrs. Earlene Roberts


        The testimony of the above-listed individuals should be
clearly taken since they have knowledge of Oswald's activities both
prior to and after the assassination.


        Hiram L. Conway. (underlined) Conway is the division manager of the
Leslie Welding Company, Oswald's first employer after his return
from Russia. The FBI report on Conway (page 285 of DC 5) indicates
that Conway has no personal knowledge of Oswald's personal life out-
side of the plant other than that which appears on his employment
application. As a result, I do not think that Conway's deposition need
be taken.


        Mrs. John G. Graves. (underlined) It appears from the FBI report on
Mrs. Graves (page 283 of DC 5) that she has only marginal information
about Oswald and that the taking of her testimony would probably not
be justified.


      Tommy Bargas. (underlined) Bargas is shop foreman for Leslie Welding
Company and seems to know more about Oswald's work there than
anyone else. Accordingly, his testimony should be taken, on the
basic proposition that we are going to interview at least one of Oswald's
co-employees from each of his former places of employment.

    Dennis H. Ofstein
    John Graef
    Robert L. Stovall


    These three individuals are associated with Jaggars - Chiles- 
Stovall, the photographic firm for which Oswald worked from
October 1962 to May 1963. Graef seemed to be Oswald's immediate
supervisor and Ofstein was another trainee photographer who
commenced work about the same time Oswald did. I think the
testimony of both of those gentlemen should be taken. Perhaps
Mr. Stovall's testimony should also be taken so that a brief inquiry
as to the nature of any classified work done by J-C-S may be made.


         Robert Taylor
         G. E. Smith


        These gentlemen were employees of a Shell Service Station
on the corner of the Rock Island and Story Streets, Irving, Texas, in
the period around April 1963. Taylor says that he bought a rifle
from a man who he thinks was Oswald. This gas station is only six
blocks from the Paine residence in Irving. The taking of these men's
Testimony could be justified, although it does not seem absolutely
necessary at this point.


       Mr. and Mrs. Floyd Davis. (underlined) These people own and operate
the Sports Dome Gun Range in Grand Prairie, Texas, where Oswald
was alleged to have practiced with his rifle. The taking of their
testimony should be deferred until after Dr. Wood and his son have
been examined concerning their statements that they saw Oswald at
the above Gun Range. A determination of whether or not the Davises'
testimony should be taken can better be made at that time.


       Dr. Homer Wood
       Sterling Charles Wood
       Kenneth Longley


       The Woods say they saw Oswald at the above rifle range on 
the afternoon of November 16, 1963, and their testimony on this
point should probably be taken.


       Mr. and Mrs. M. F. Tobias. (underlined)  Tobias is the manager of the
apartment house at 602-604 Elsbeth Street, Dallas, and recalled

renting an apartment at 604 Elsbeth to Oswald on November 3, 1962.
Tobias and his wife probably should be examined since the FBI report
shows that they observed a man named "George" (probably
Do Mohrenschildt) come to Oswald's apartment. The FBI report
indicates that the FBI had an application to rent the apartment at
604 Elsbeth which they showed to Tobias when they interviewed him,
and this should be obtained before Tobias is examined.


        Cliff Roberts. (underlined) Roberts is a private detective who investigated
the attempt on General Walker's life particularly with reference to
the possible involvement with Mr. William McEwen Duff. Roberts
should probably be questioned at some point, but not until we have had
an opportunity to do a thorough background analysis of the Walker
incident.


      Roy Truly. (underlined) Messrs. Ball and Belin have a much greater
interest in Mr. Truly than we do. I do not know whether they plan
to take Mr. Truly is to appear before the Commission itself. Accordingly,
I think the taking of Mr. Truly's deposition should be postponed until
after we have conferred with Messrs. Ball and Belin.

Mr. Walter E. Craig
President, American Bar Association
1120 Connecticut Avenue, N.W.
Washington, D.C. 20035


Dear Mr. Craig:
       
           As I mentioned to you during our meeting last Monday,
members of the Commission staff are currently in Dallas taking the 
depositions of various witnesses. I wish to confirm my invitation
to you or your representative to participate during the taking of
those depositions in the same manner in which you are currently
taking part in the presentation of evidence before the Commission.


          So that you are fully informed regarding the name of the
witnesses currently being deposed, I am attaching to this letter a
list of witnesses whose depositions to be deposed this week by Mr. Specter,
primarily doctors and other personnel of Parkland Hospital. The
second column sets forth the names of witnesses to be handled by 
Messrs. Rubert and Griffin of the Commission staff, including offi-
cials of the Dallas Police Department and the Sheriff's office at
Dallas, who will be interrogated regarding the handling of Lee Harvey
Oswald on November 24, 1963. The third column lists the witnesses to
be handled by Messers. Jenner and Idebeler and includes persons of the
Dallass community familier with certain of Oswald's activities in the
months preceding the assassination. These members of the staff are
under instructions to take those depositions as expeditiously as can
be arranged.


(handwritten on the left side of the page) ((? xxow)) 3/25/64 J.P.R. 


                  I anticipate that the process of taking depositions in
Dallas will last through approximately Friday, April 10th. Next
week Mr. Hubert will remain in Dallas to interrogate witnesses

associated with Jack ruby and his activities prior to the killing
of Lee Harvey Oswald on November 24, 1963. Depositions will also
be taken next week and the following week by Messers. Ball and Belin
of the Commission staff. These attorneys will be interrogating
additional witnesses from the Dallas Police Department concerned
with the investigation of the assassination and various other Dallas
witnesses with information to supply regarding Lee Harvey Oswald's
involvement in the assassination. When I have authorised the
depositions of specific witnesses in this area, I shall supply you
with a list of the names.


            I hope that there arrangements meet with your approval.


                                           Sincerely,
              
                                           SIGNED
