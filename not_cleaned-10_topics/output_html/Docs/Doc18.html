       THOMAS RAY (checkmark) resident of Northeast Brossom,
Texas, telephone 334-5244, an employee of the Gulf Oil
Company, Paris, Texas, appeared at the Paris, Texas,
Resident Agency of the FBI and volunteered the following
information:


       RAY explained that he was married to a Russian
girl in Germany in 1946, and he soon thereafter returned
to the United States with her. She was subsequently
naturalized and received her citizenship papers in
Federal Court in Paris, Texas.


       RAY stated that there is a group of former
Russians throughout the State of Texas who try to keep
in touch with one another from time to time and that
because his wife was a native-born Russian she was invited
to a party in Dallas, Texas, on December 28 - 29, 1962,
in attendance at which were many other Russians. The
party lasted two days and among those present was LEE
HARVEY OSWALD. Mr. RAY stated that in view of OSWALD's
presence he felt that the people at this party might have
information concerning OSWALD and should possibly be con-
tacted by the FBI in connection with the investigation
of the assassination of President KENNEDY.


        RAY advised that many of the people present at
the party would have considerable information about OSWALD
and his family.


       RAY stated he did not pay too much attention
to OSWALD at the party since OSWALD talked mostly to the
Russian-speaking people at the party. He commented that
OSWALD spoke Russian fluently and that Mrs. RAY had talked
to OSWALD at length, and she expressed her amazement at
OSWALD's understanding of Russian and his talk concerning
the Communist Party line.


       Mr. RAY stated that the party described above
was held at the home of Mr. and Mrs. DECLAN T. FORD, (check mark)
14057 Brookcrest Drive, Dallas, Texas, telephone AD 9-5642.
He stated that Mrs. DECLAN T. FORD is a Russian.

      RAY stated that also in attendance was GEORGE
BOUHE (checkmark) 4740 Homer Street, Apartment 0, telephone TA 7-2288,
Dallas, Texas. RAY identified BOUHE as a bachelor who
apparently keeps in contact with as many Russian-born
people as he can.


    Also at this party were Mr. and Mrs. TEOFIL
MELLER (checkmark) 5930 1/2 LaVista Drive, telephone TA 3-2219, Dallas,
Texas. Both of these people are Russian born.


    Also present at the party was an individual
named FRANK RAY (checkmark) and his Russian-born wife. FRANK RAY is
no relation to THOMAS RAY, and THOMAS RAY stated he did
not know their address and that they may now be separated.


   RAY explained that a businessman, C.E. HARRIS, JR.,
904 East 12th Street, Georgetown, Texas, telephone VN 3-3086,
and his wife, who is Russian born, were also at the party.


     When the party broke up at the FORD residence,
many of the persons present, including the RAYs, went to
a very lavish home somewhere in Dallas. The owners of
this home, both American, were supposedly business people,
and the husband is the son of a pioneer of Dallas. RAY
stated that this man's wife remarked that her husband owned
"ten acres of downtown Dallas".


     RAY explained that BOUHE, the MELLERs and the
FORDs befriended OSWALD, and one of these families had
allowed Mrs. OSWALD to live with them for a long period of
time. It was understood that OSWALD mistreated his wife
a great deal and that he did not appreciate any help given
to him for his ill-kept family.
