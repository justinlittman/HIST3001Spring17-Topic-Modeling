Date: December 5, 1963


KENNETH HUDSON CROY, residence 2634 West Illinois, was interviewed at his place of business, H.E. Roy and Son Real Estate, 1720 South Lamer. He was advised he need not make any statement, that any statement he did make could be used against him in a court of law. He was advised of his right to an attorney. He furnished the following information:
He is a Sergeant in the Dallas, Texas Police Reserve and has been for a good number go years. 
On November 23, 1963, at approximately 11:00 P.M., Lieutenant BEN McCOY, Dallas Police Department, telephonically advised he would need six or seven reserve policemen to report to the third floor of the Police Department at 9:00 A.M. on November 24, 1963.
He arrived at about 8:30 A.M., November 24, 1963, at the Police Department and went to the Assembly Room to make detail. Lieutenant BARNEY MERRELL gave him the duty of assigning men out of the Assembly Room as required by the other police officials. He thereafter sent groups of men downstairs when called for by the police dispatcher. At one point, a sergeant, name unknown, came in and secured five men to help search the building. 
At about 10:00 A.M., he went to the basement parking area on his own volition to aid in the basement security. He thereafter located men when more were called for by the various police officers present. 
Captain ARNETT, around 11:00 A.M., requested some policemen to form on the Main Street side of the center ramp area to aid in keeping members of the press back from the area where LEE HARVEY OSWALD was to be passed through. 
He recalls shortly before the shooting, a few minutes at most, a blue Dallas police car drove out of the basement up the Main Street ramp past his location. He did not see anyone coming down the Main Street ramp. He recalls there was one regular police man, name unknown, stationed at the Main Street ramp entrance
