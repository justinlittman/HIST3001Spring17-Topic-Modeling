THE WHITE HOUSE                        
WASHINGTON


July 20, 1964


My Dear Mr. Chief Justice:


I have attempted, in the enclosed statement, to set forth my recollection of the tragic events of November 22, 1963. I am conscious of the limitations of my narrative. I had no opportunity, in the difficult and critical days following the assassination of President Kennedy, to record my impressions. Recollection at this late date is necessarily incomplete.


However, I fully realize the great importance of your task, and I have endeavored, as best as I can, to set forth the events and my impressions as they remain in my mind at this time. Although I fear that they will be of little specific use to you, I hope that they may be of some interest.


I hope that you and the members of your Commission, as well as the devoted members of the staff who worked so long and diligently on this undertaking, will accept my thanks and good wishes.


Sincerely,
Lyndon B. Johnson






The Honorable Earl Warren
The Chief Justice
Of the United States
Washington, D.C.


Enclosure






















Statement of the President, Lyndon Baines Johnson, concerning the events of November 22, 1963


Friday morning, November 22d, began with a reception in the Longhorn Room of the Hotel Texas, Fort Worth. President and Mrs. Kennedy and Mrs. Johnson and I had spent the night in that hotel. Then, President Kennedy and I went to a parking lot across from the hotel where a speaker’s stand had been set up and we addressed a crowd that was gathered there. We then returned to the hotel and had breakfast.


After that, at about 10:30 a.m., we motored to the Forth Worth air field. Mrs. Johnson and I then went aboard Air Force II for the trip to Dallas.


        We arrived at Love Field in Dallas, as I remember, just shortly after 11:30 a.m.


        Agents Youngblood and Johns and two other agents were with us.


        We disembarked from the plane promptly after it came to a stop at Love Field. We were met by a committee of local officials and citizens. After






















































greeting them, Mrs. Johnson and I, together with the Special Agents, walked over to the area where President and Mrs. Kennedy would disembark. We were followed by the reception committee.


        Then the President and Mrs. Kennedy walked along the fence shaking hands with people in the crowd that had assembled. Mrs. Johnson and I followed along the fence greeting people and shaking hands. This took five or ten minutes, as I recall.


        Mrs. Johnson, Senator Ralph Yarborough and I then entered the car which had been provided for us in the motorcade. It was a Lincoln Continental convertible. I think that our car was fourth in the motorcade. We were the second car behind the President’s automobile.


        The driver of the car in which Mrs. Johnson and I were riding was Herschel Jacks, who is a member






























































of the Texas State Highway Patrol. Agent Youngblood was sitting next to him in the front seat.


        I was sitting behind Agent Youngblood, Mrs. Johnson was next to me and Senator Yarborough was on the left of the rear sear – that is, just behind the driver.


        At first, as we left Love Field and proceeded through the less-populated areas, the crowds were thin. I recall, however, that Mrs. Johnson and I and Senator Yarborough commented upon the good spirit and obvious good wishes of the crowd. As we drove closer to town, the crowds became qu...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(59%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic4.html>president mrs kennedy car johnson seat hill agents kellerman air</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(9%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic6.html>mr hubert chief office department crull city police page present</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(9%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic8.html>time dallas police special immediately shot stated john connally found</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(5%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic7.html>sa governor president left wound vice connally hospital area handwritten</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
