to permit them to do so or came to a halt.
        There are special steps and handles built into the President's
car at the two rear corners especially so that agents riding the 
front running board  of the Presidential follow-up car can ride
there; the President had frequently stated that he did not wish 
to have the agents riding on these steps during a motorcade and
had repeated this wish only a few days previously to agents
assigned to him in Tampa. (In Dallas SA Hill, who had been 
assigned to Mrs. Kennedy and had not been in Tampa with the 
President, occasionally rode on the left rear step. Agent Ready, 
who was aware that the president has specifically stated his 
objection to agents' riding on the steps, did not ride the [stop?]
in Dallas.)

      II. NARRATIVE OF EVENTS IN DALLAS ON NOVEMBER 22, 1963 [typed, underlined]
         The Presidential aircraft touched down at Love Field, 
Dallas, Texas, at about 11:37 a.m., November 22, 1963.  The
weather was sunny with temperatures in the 70's.  At 11:40 a.m.,
the President came out from the rear exit of his plane and down
the ramp, together with Mrs. Kennedy, Governor and Mrs. Connally
and other members of his party.  ASAIC Kellerman and SA Hill 
also came out the rear exit. ATSAIC Roberts and SA's Ready, 
Lawton, McIntyre and Greer, came down the front ramp and with 
the exception of Greer (the driver of the President's car) , 
promptly joined the others with the President and Mrs. Kennedy. 
ASAIC Youngblood, assisted by ATSAIC Johns, and SA's Kivett and 
Warren Taylor, took positions in proximity to the Vice 
President and Mrs. Johnson. 
       The President and Mrs. Kennedy then walked sown a receiving
line, shaking hands with fifteen to twenty persons of the local
committee.  The First Lady was presented with a bouquet of red 
roses, and the President with two charcoal drawings in a leather
frame which he handed to SA Landis to hold.  The President and 
Mrs. Kennedy then walked over to a lady seated in a wheelchair be-
tween the airplane and the chain link fence where the crowd was [typed]

and friendly as the President and Mrs. Kennedy moved along.  At
one point Mrs. Kennedy seemed to fall slightly behind the President 
and the agents then made it possible for her to catch up with 
her husband.  At one time Mrs. Kennedy turned away from the 
fence to proceed to the Presidential car accompanies by the
agents guarding her. but then noticed that the President had 
continued down the fence and rejoined him.  At another point
where the fence makes a right angle the President started to 
move out to his car but then turned back and resumed the
handshaking for an additional brief interval, All along this
fence were Dallas policemen at frequent intervals, posted
 looking at the crowd, while in the crowd were a number of plain-
clothesmen of the Dallas Police Department. 
        The Vice President and Mrs. Johnson also shook hands with 
people in the crowd, following the President and Mrs. Kennedy 
along the fence.  During this time and throughout the occasion, 
they were guarded by four members of the Vice Presidential Detail, 
namely: ASAIC Youngblood, ATSAIC Johns, SA Kivett, and SA Warren
Taylor. SA Taylor was detailed on this trip to accompany
Mrs. Johnson. [typed]

Sir:


INTRODUCTION [underlined]


Reference is made to my preliminary survey report dated November 19. 1963. 


This survey was conducted by SA Winston Lawson, Office 1-16, and SAIC 
Forrest Sorrels, Office 3-3, and assisted by SA David Grant, Office 1-16, 
from November 13 through November 22, 1963. SA Jerry Kivett, Office 1-22, 
coordinated the Vice President's plans for the visit from November 18
through November 22, 1963. 


A large crowd was on hand to greet the Presidential Party at the airport. 
The motorcade route was lined by crowds which were quite large, especially
in the downtown area.  The invited guests were awaiting the arrival of 
the Presidential Party at the Trade Mart, the site of the luncheon and 
speech.


Appropriate attire for this luncheon was a business suit. 


ITINERARY [underlined]


11:35 a.m.  The Vice President and Mrs. Johnson accompanied by other
                   members of the party arrived at Love Field, Dallas,

11:40 a.m.     The President, Mrs. Kennedy, and Governor and Mrs. 
                      Connally, accompanied by other members of the party, 
                      arrived at Love Field, Dallas, Texas.  (See attached

                      Attachment #2.


                      The President was met by members of the party from
                      AF #2 and the local reception committee.  Mrs. Kennedy, 
                      Mrs. Johnson, and Mrs, Connally were presented flowers.

                      George Miner and Mr. David Keeler were deleted.)
 
                      The President, Mrs. Kennedy, the Vice President and 
                      Mrs. Johnson walked along the airport fence shaking 
                      hands and greeting the crowd.  The motorcade vehicles 
                      were being loaned at this time.  (See Scheduled 
                      Motorcade List.)  Attachment #3. 


11:55 a.m.     The Presidential Party departed the airport. 


12:29 p.m.     Appropriate signal given by SA Lawson from Lead Car that 
                      we were approximately five minutes from destination - 
                      the Trade Mart. 


12:30 p.m.     Because of what appeared to be the sound of a firecracker
(Approx.)       or gunfire, also because of unusual activity in the 
                      Presidential and follow-up cars, we immediately accelerated
                      movement of Lead Car. Information was received over the 
                      two-way radio that we should proceed to the nearest hospital, 
                      and we were escorted speedily to the Parkland Hospital.
                      The President and Governor Cannily were placed on stretchers
                      and were immediately take to the Emergency Room for medical
                      attention.  (See my statement and statements from other
                      agents as to activities during this incident.)


                      Note[underlined]:  Separate reports containing information on activities
                      at the hospital and subsequent trips of the Vice President
                      and the body of the President to Love Field and their
                      departure for Washington, D. C., will be submitted as soon 
                      as practical.


                      Note[underlined]:  The following is the approximate scheduling of
                      events and itinerary for the remainder of the visit.

The general public was contained behind a chain link fence with police
crowd and check point control.  In addition, general public was contained
behind parking lot fence with police control.  The press area was located
near the rear ramp of AF #1 and was formed by ropes and stanchions with
police to contain the press and move the press area roped if needed. 
Agents were deployed around the President and Mrs. Kennedy and the Vice
President and Mrs. Johnson as they walked along the fence to the crowd 
area.  Police were also used on adjacent and near-by airport building 
roofs, for traffic control, and to keep the public from access roads and 
other areas not to be used by the public.  Plain-clothes officers were
stationed in and around the general public.  (See attached airport area
map - Attachment #6 - and airport reception area diagram - Attachment 
#7.)


Route - Security [underlined]


Security of the route was effected by agents of this Service traveling
with the motorcade, escorting police automobiles and motorcycles, and 
strategically deployed police along the route. 


Uniformed police were utilized at main intersections, both for crowd and 
traffic control.  Outriders of escorting motorcycles were used for traffic
control at secondary intersections as the motorcade proceeded along the 
route and to clear any traffic ahead. Motorcycles were utilized ahead
of the pilot car, the lead car, the right and left flanks of the Presi-
dent's car and Secret Service follow-up car to keep the people off the 
street.  Other motorcycles and a police car were utilized at the rear of 
motorcade to keep it intact and prevent any vehicle from passing the 
motorcade. 


Additional police officers were stationed along the motorcade route in 
areas where large crowds were expected and where the motorcade might be
moving more slowly.  City trucks were positioned along the motorcade 
route with personnel assigned to clear the streets of refuse or other
objects thrown into the street. 


All bridges, overpasses and railroad crossings on the route were policed. 
There was no scheduled passenger rail traffic on the two rail crossings
which bisected the route during the times the motorcade was to pass. 
Police were stationed at these crossings to control any freight switch-
ing. 


Possible picketing and embarrassing incidents were discussed.  The police 
were to enforce local ordinances in this respect.  A copy of a local 
ordinance dated November 18, 1963, concerning picketing or interference 
with private or public assemblies is attached. Attachment #8.  [typed]

Catering for the luncheon was furnished by Crotty Bros., Boston, 
Massachusetts, the contract catered for the Trade Mart. They 
normally operate the Trade Mart cafeteria on food service. The Presi-
dent's food supply was to come from the general food supply, and the 
head table waiters, food preparers, and Crotty Bros. personnel were 
listed and names and data sent by SAIC Sorrels, Dallas, to our Protec-
tive Research Section for processing.  Any catering personnel in 
proximity to the head table were identified by green lapel clips. 


The Dallas Fire Department conducted a safety inspection and had fire-
men deployed in the Trade Mart with protective equipment.  The Dallas
Health Department inspected the kitchen area and facilities. 


The general public was not allowed in the parking lot area where the
motorcade would pass and was to stop.  No public vehicles were allowed
to park in the lot.  It was secured by ropes and barricades.  Police 
officers were placed on the roof of the Trade Mart, Market Hall, and 
Dallas Home Furnishings Mart, as they overlooked the point where the 
President would alight from his vehicle.  Police were also utilized for 
crowd, traffic, and parking control at the Trade Mart. 


Special instructions were sent to lessees of the Trade Mart by W. E. 
Cooper, General Manager, Dallas Market Center.  (See attachment #9.)
