Texas, telephone 334-5244, an employee of the Gulf Oil
Company, Paris, Texas, appeared at the Paris, Texas,
Resident Agency of the FBI and volunteered the following
information:


       RAY explained that he was married to a Russian
girl in Germany in 1946, and he soon thereafter returned
to the United States with her. She was subsequently
naturalized and received her citizenship papers in
Federal Court in Paris, Texas.


       RAY stated that there is a group of former
Russians throughout the State of Texas who try to keep
in touch with one another from time to time and that
because his wife was a native-born Russian she was invited
to a party in Dallas, Texas, on December 28 - 29, 1962,
in attendance at which were many other Russians. The
party lasted two days and among those present was LEE
HARVEY OSWALD. Mr. RAY stated that in view of OSWALD's
presence he felt that the people at this party might have
information concerning OSWALD and should possibly be con-
tacted by the FBI in connection with the investigation
of the assassination of President KENNEDY.


        RAY advised that many of the people present at
the party would have considerable information about OSWALD
and his family.


       RAY stated he did not pay too much attention
to OSWALD at the party since OSWALD talked mostly to the
Russian-speaking people at the party. He commented that
OSWALD spoke Russian fluently and that Mrs. RAY had talked
to OSWALD at length, and she expressed her amazement at
OSWALD's understanding of Russian and his talk concerning
the Communist Party line.


       Mr. RAY stated that the party described above
was held at the home of Mr. and Mrs. DECLAN T. FORD,
14057 Brookcrest Drive, Dallas, Texas, telephone AD 9-5642.
He stated that Mrs. DECLAN T. FORD is a Russian.

      RAY stated that also in attendance was GEORGE
BOUHE  4740 Homer Street, Apartment 0, telephone TA 7-2288,
Dallas, Texas. RAY identified BOUHE as a bachelor who
apparently keeps in contact with as many Russian-born
people as he can.


    Also at this party were Mr. and Mrs. TEOFIL
MELLER  5930 1/2 LaVista Drive, telephone TA 3-2219, Dallas,
Texas. Both of these people are Russian born.


    Also present at the party was an individual
named FRANK RAY  and his Russian-born wife. FRANK RAY is
no relation to THOMAS RAY, and THOMAS RAY stated he did
not know their address and that they may now be separated.


   RAY explained that a businessman, C.E. HARRIS, JR.,
904 East 12th Street, Georgetown, Texas, telephone VN 3-3086,
and his wife, who is Russian born, were also at the party.


     When the party broke up at the FORD residence,
many of the persons present, including the RAYs, went to
a very lavish home somewhere in Dallas. The owners of
this home, both American, were supposedly business people,
and the husband is the son of a pioneer of Dallas. RAY
stated that this man's wife remarked that her husband owned
"ten acres of downtown Dallas".


     RAY explained that BOUHE, the MELLERs and the
FORDs befriended OSWALD, and one of these families had
allowed Mrs. OSWALD to live with them for a long period of
time. It was understood that OSWALD mistreated his wife
a great deal and that he did not appreciate any help given
to him for his ill-kept family.

        Mr. FRANK RAY,  co-owner of the Pollock-Ray Company,
3508 Dickason, was recontacted to determine if he had any acquaintance
and/or knowledge of LEE HARVEY OSWALD and JACK RUBY. Mr. RAY
stated he had been acquainted with OSWALD, having met him twice
during a period from November 1, 1962, to January 1, 1963.
Mr. RAY advised he was not acquainted with JACK RUBY and knew
of no association between RUBY and OSWALD. He stated that during
his conversation with LEE HARVEY OSWALD he had never heard the
name JACK RUBY mentioned.

       Mr. FRANK HENRY RAY,  4524 Alta Vista Lane,
was reinterviewed at his place of business, Pollock-Ray
Company, 3508 Dickason Street, Dallas, Texas, and advised
he could furnish no information concerning the
residence of LEE HARVEY OSWALD for the period October 19
through November 2, 1962.

DETAILS
                              SYNOPSIS
Known Russian associates of Lee Harvey Oswald and his
wife were personally interviewed in regards to their
relationship. Nothing was developed to indicate the
persons contacted had any knowledge of the assassi-
nation plot.


 K. P.
George de Mohrenschildt,  a Russian who is reported to
have maintained a close relationship with Oswald, is
presently residing in Port Au Prince, Haiti. The matter
of an interview with de Mohrenschildt is referred to the
Chief's Office for determination.


DETAILS OF INVESTIGATION


   Reference is made to previous reports.


   On December 2, 1963, it was ascertained that Alex Kleinlerner  (name
found on piece of paper in wallet of Lee Oswald) is a foreign representative
for Loma Industries, a plastics production company located at 3000 Pafford
Road, Fort Worth, Texas.


     Mr. Kleinlerner was personally interviewed at his place of employment
December 3, 1963, by SA Maurice Miller and the reporting agent. He stated
he resides at 3542 1/2 Kent Street, telephone WA 3-2525, Fort Worth. He is 40
years of age and single. He claims to have been born in Poland of Polish
parents, both of whom died in German concentration camps during World War
II. He was confined to Buchenwald until 1945 when he was liberated by
General Patton's forces. He immediately moved to Checkoslovakia and then
to France. From France he came to the United States in May 1956 and



immediately found employment with Loma Industries. He returned to France
as a foreign representative for that company in November 1957, and made a
visit to this country for a couple of weeks duration in July or August 1959.
He again returned to this country in June 1961 and became a naturalized
citizen in May 1963. Because of his ability to speak a number of European
languages, Mr. Kleinlerner has become associated with numerous foreign
speaking individuals in the Fort Worth-Dallas area. These include Anna
Meller,  George Bouhe,  George de Mohrenschildt, Peter Gregory,  Mrs. Max
Clark,  and Mrs. Elena Hall.
 K. P.


      Mr. Kleinlerner stated he was very much in love with Mrs. Hall during
1962, who was then divorced from her husband. He recalls that one Sunday
morning which he believes was in September 1962, he was working in Mrs. Hall's
garage at 4760 Trail Lake Drive, Fort Worth, building wooden baffles for
stero speakers, George Bouhe drove up in his automobile with Lee Oswald,
his wife and child. During this approximate 45 minutes visit, Mr. Bouhe
inquired of Mrs. Hall about Marina's dental problems, Mrs. Hall being a
dental technician. Mr. Kleinlerner met the Oswalds on this occasion for
the first time and stated that Lee was almost totally uncommuncative.


      Mrs. Hall was injured in an automobile accident in Fort Worth in 1962
while Marina and the child were residing at her home. Later, after being
released from the hospital and after having spent a few days at home, Mrs.
Hall on October 31, 1962, departed Fort Worth for Garden City, New York, to
visit friends. Mr. Kleinlerner stated that while Mrs. Hall was in the hospi-
tal and in New York, he frequently called on Marina during his lunch period
to determine her needs and her welfare. He stated that the group of friends
with which he was socially acquainted who speak Russian had genuine pity for
Marin and the child, but none of them cared for Lee because of his political
philosophy and lack of interest in anything else. He stated he only saw Lee
Oswald when he accompanied Mrs. Hall to take clothes for Mrs. Oswald or the
child and has the impression that both Lee and Marina were professional bums.
He stated he made remarks to this effect to Mrs. Hall, but Mrs. Hall and other
women in their social group felt that Marina needed help since she was with-
out clothes and the child slept on the floor. He last saw the Oswalds about
the first of November 1962.


       Mr. Kleinlerner stated he saw Lee Oswald on one occasion at 4760 Trail
Lake Drive, Fort Worth, when he visited the address during Mrs. Hall's
absence to determine the needs of Marina and the child. During this visit,
Lee observed that the zipper on his wife's skirt was not completely closed,
and he took her into another room where he hit her a number of times. The
only other time Mr. Kleinlerner saw Lee was on one or two occasions when he
accompanied Mrs. Hall when she took clothing and other articles to Marina and
the child at 2703 Mercedes, Fort Worth.


      He stated Mrs. Hall left Fort Worth October 31, 1962, to visit friends
in New York; that Marina and the chid stayed until November 5 or 12, 1962,
when Marina telephoned him and said they were joining Lee at Dallas. Mr.

Kleinlerner stated Alexa, surname unknown (husband was then a taxi driver
at Dallas) moved Marina and the child. Alexa is believed to be the daughter
of George de Mohrenschildt.


        Mr. Kleinlerner has not seen the Oswalds since they left Fort Worth.
 MRS. DECLAN FORD
 K. P.

        On December 7, 1963, accompanied by SA Edward Moore, the reporting agent
personally interviewed Mrs. Katherine Ford (White, female, 37, 5-7 1/2, 135,
dark brown hair, brown eyes) at her residence, 14057 Brookcrest, Dallas, Texas.
Mrs. Ford was born Katherine Evstratova in Novotcherkassk, U.S.S.R., and lived
there until the age of 17, at which time the Germans took her from Russia and
placed her in a concentration camp. Her mother, Maria Evstratova, and some
sisters still reside in this Russian community. Mrs. Ford said she met and
married an American GI by the name of Stanley Skotnicki, and in 1946 they
came to the United States and settled in his hometown of Dallas. Mrs. Ford
stated that she divorced Stanley Skotnicki in 1960. Mr. Skotnicki lives at
2021 N. Fitzhugh, Dallas, TA 7-2347, and operates a real estate office at
1829 N. Henderson, Dallas. Mrs. Ford became a United States citizen February
1, 1952, while she was still married to Stanley Skotnicki.


       Some of the people in this city of Russian exeraction remain in close
contact, and it was through her Russian friends she met the Oswalds. She
said one of her Russian friends, Paul Gregory,  had met Oswald in the Fort
Worth Library and had asked him and his wife to meet some of the other
Russians living here. Mrs. Ford said she first met the Oswalds at a party
given in the home of Mrs. Anna Meller. Another Russian, George A. Bouhe,
4740 Homer, Dallas, TA 7-2288, thought they should try to help the Oswalds
because Lee was out of a job and the baby needed clothes, a bed, etc. Mrs.
Ford said that of all the Russians who had contact with Marina, George Bouhe
seemed to be closest to her. He had gained her confidence and Marina would
call him about her problems. Bouhe told Mrs. Ford that he had spent about
$50 on things for Marina and the baby. Mrs. Ford said Lee Oswald did not
want gifts and he resented the help everyone gave Marina and the baby. Mrs.
Ford said she always thought Oswald was a "nut" because he seemed to blame
others for his own problems. She stated Oswald was extremely independent.


        Marina had called George Bouhe and said Lee had beaten her and she
wanted to leave him. Apparently someone picked Marina up from their apart-
ment at 602 Elsbeth Street, and took her and the baby to Anna Meller's. It
was later established that Marina took a taxi to Mrs. Meller's home.


       Mrs. Ford recalls Marina came to Anna Meller's home the last week in
October 1962. Mrs. Meller called Mrs. Ford and asked if she could keep
Marina and the baby because the Meller apartment was too small. Mrs. Ford
agreed to keep them and Marina and her daughter arrived at the Ford's the
first week in November and remained one week. At the end of the week, some
other friends, Frank  and Anna Ray,  took Marina and the baby into their home.


The same day Marina moved in with the Rays, Lee came to see Marina and
talked her into returning home with him. Mrs. Ford said she did not see the
Oswalds again until Christmas when they came to a party she was giving for
her Russian friends. Mrs. Ford said she never saw either Marina or Lee again
after December 1962. She said she usually heard of the Oswalds movements
through her friends. In the spring of 1963, a friend Lydia Dymitruk told
her Marina said they were moving to New Orleans.


       Lee or Marina never talked about politics in the presence of Mrs. Ford.
She said it was uncommon for politics to be discussed at any of the gather-
ings, but Lee frequently mentioned his life in Russia, and indicated he would
like to return to that country. Mrs. Ford said she and her friends did not
like Lee's preference of Russia over the United States, and George Bouhe had
been to the Oswald apartment and seen several Communist writings. For this
reason her friends decided to stay away from the Oswalds. A Russian by the
name of George de Mohrenschildt continued his companionship with Lee Oswald,
and Mrs. Ford said that George and Lee were quite friendly. Mrs. Ford says
that in her opinion de Mohrenschildt is sympathetic to the Communist belief.
She stated she formed this opinion from de Mohrenschildt's attitude and his
conversations in reference to laws in this country. She said Lee Oswald had
a similar philosophy and this probably accounts for his close relationship
with de Mohrenschildt. Mrs. Ford said de Mohrenschildt had left for Prt
au Prince, Haiti in th esummer of 1963 to visit the President of Haiti. they
are reported to be good friends and de Mohrenschildt is over there looking
for oil on behalf of the President. She said she thought de Mohrenschildt
may have worked for the United States Government at one time.


        When asked if she knew Mrs. Ruth Paine, whom Marina lived with briefly,
Mrs. Ford stated she does not know Ruth Paine personally and the first she
heard of her was when she read Mrs. Paine's name in the newspaper. This was
after the assassination and she called Mrs. Paine in an effort to contact
Marina and offer help to her and the children.


        George de Mohrenschildt is a geologist and is described as follows:
White, male, 45, 6'2", 195, light brown hair, fair complexion, gray or blue
eyes. He has a brother who is a professor of language at Dartmouth College.


        Mr. Samuel Ballen,  8715 Midway, Dallas, Texas, friend of George
de Mohrenschildt, was contacted by telephone and he said he last heard from
George de Mohrenschildt about the middle of November and he indicated he
would remain in Haiti. Mr. Ballen furnished the following address for
de Mohrenschildt: c/o U. S. Embassy, Port au Prince, Haiti.


        On December 7, 1963, accompanied by SA Bailey, the reporting agent inter-
viewed George A. Bouhe at his apartmentat 4740 Homer, Dallas, Texas, TA 7-2288.
Mr. Bouhe was born in Russia and came to the United States in 1924. He moved
to Dallas in 1934 and has lived her until the present. Mr. Bouhe is described
as white, male, 69, 5'9", 140, top of head bald with gray sides, wears glasses,
and is a retired accountant.

     Mr. Bouhe stated that his first contact with the Oswalds was on Satur-
day, August 25, 1962, at a dinner party given at the home of Peter Gregory
in Fort Worth. Present at this party were Mr. and Mrs. Gregory, their son
Paul, Mrs. Anna Meller, and the Oswalds. Paul Gregory picked the Oswalds
up at their apartment and brought them to the party. Mr. Bouhe said he was
interested in the Old Country and that he talked at length with Marina Oswald
about living conditions in Russia. He said he and Marina spoke in their
native tongue of Russian because Marina could not speak English. Mr. Bouhe
said that Lee Oswald was very quite, sultry, and stayed to himself during
most of the evening. When Lee spoke he appeared to be doing so only to be
polite. When Lee entered in the conversation he spoke with favor toward the
Russian way of life, and Mr. Bouhe said that in his opinion Lee Oswald had
once remarked how well he liked the duck hunting in Russia. In previous
reports it has been mentioned that Lee Oswald belonged to a hunt club in
Russia when he lived there.


       Mr. Bouhe said that in his conversations with Lee Harvey Oswald they
never discussed the political situation in either Russia or the United States...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(46%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic5.html>mrs oswald lee ray marina bouhe russian party oswalds meller</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(24%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic19.html>dallas texas stated home ford oswald time harvey interviewed apartment</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(16%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic18.html>mr office states united people told subject general asked wife</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
