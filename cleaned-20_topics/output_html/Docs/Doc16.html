I am conscious of the limitations of my narrative. I had no opportunity, in the difficult and critical days following the assassination of President Kennedy, to record my impressions. Recollection at this late date is necessarily incomplete.


However, I fully realize the great importance of your task, and I have endeavored, as best as I can, to set forth the events and my impressions as they remain in my mind at this time. Although I fear that they will be of little specific use to you, I hope that they may be of some interest.


I hope that you and the members of your Commission, as well as the devoted members of the staff who worked so long and diligently on this undertaking, will accept my thanks and good wishes.

Friday morning, November 22d, began with a reception in the Longhorn Room of the Hotel Texas, Fort Worth. President and Mrs. Kennedy and Mrs. Johnson and I had spent the night in that hotel. Then, President Kennedy and I went to a parking lot across from the hotel where a speaker’s stand had been set up and we addressed a crowd that was gathered there. We then returned to the hotel and had breakfast.


After that, at about 10:30 a.m., we motored to the Forth Worth air field. Mrs. Johnson and I then went aboard Air Force II for the trip to Dallas.


        We arrived at Love Field in Dallas, as I remember, just shortly after 11:30 a.m.


        Agents Youngblood and Johns and two other agents were with us.


        We disembarked from the plane promptly after it came to a stop at Love Field. We were met by a committee of local officials and citizens. After

greeting them, Mrs. Johnson and I, together with the Special Agents, walked over to the area where President and Mrs. Kennedy would disembark. We were followed by the reception committee.


        Then the President and Mrs. Kennedy walked along the fence shaking hands with people in the crowd that had assembled. Mrs. Johnson and I followed along the fence greeting people and shaking hands. This took five or ten minutes, as I recall.


        Mrs. Johnson, Senator Ralph Yarborough and I then entered the car which had been provided for us in the motorcade. It was a Lincoln Continental convertible. I think that our car was fourth in the motorcade. We were the second car behind the President’s automobile.


        The driver of the car in which Mrs. Johnson and I were riding was Herschel Jacks, who is a member
of the Texas State Highway Patrol. Agent Youngblood was sitting next to him in the front seat.


        I was sitting behind Agent Youngblood, Mrs. Johnson was next to me and Senator Yarborough was on the left of the rear sear – that is, just behind the driver.


        At first, as we left Love Field and proceeded through the less-populated areas, the crowds were thin. I recall, however, that Mrs. Johnson and I and Senator Yarborough commented upon the good spirit and obvious good wishes of the crowd. As we drove closer to town, the crowds became quite large.


        We made several stops as a result of stops by the automobile ahead of us. I did not get out of the car, but on occasion a few people broke from the crowd and ran over and I shook hands with several people on these occasions.


        The motorcade proceeded down Main Street and then turned right on Houston. It then turned into Elm which is a block, I believe beyond the intersection of Main and Houston. The crowd on Elm Street was smaller.

        As the motorcade proceeded down Elm Street to the point where the assassination occurred, it was traveling at a speed which I should estimate at 12 or 15 miles an hour.


        After we had proceeded a short way down Elm Street, I heard a sharp report. The crowd at this point had become somewhat spotty.


        The Vice-Presidential car was then about three car-lengths behind President Kennedy’s car, with the Presidential follow-up car intervening.


        I was startled by the sharp report or explosion, but I had no time to speculate as its origin because Agent Youngblood turned in a flash, immediately after the first explosion, hitting me in the shoulder, and shouted to all of us in the back seat to get down. I was pushed down by Agent Youngblood. Almost in the same moment in which he hit or pushed me, he vaulted over the back seat and sat on me.
