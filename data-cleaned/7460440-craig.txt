
Roger Craig,  7711 Piedmont, Apartment B, telephone
EVergreen 1=4851, employed as a Deputy Sheriff, Dallas
Country Sheriff's Department, was recontacted to determine
if he had any knowledge as to acquaintanceship and/or association
between LEE HARVEY OSWALD and JACK RUBY.


        Deputy CRAIG stated he had never known LEE HARVEY
OSWALD prior to November 22, 1963, on which date he observed
OSWALD in the office of Capt. J. W. FRITZ in the Homicide
and Robbery Bureau, Dallas Police Department, and identified
him as the individual he saw in the area of the Texas School
Book Depository immediately following the shooting of President JOHN F. KENNEDY.


                CRAIG stated he did not know JACK RUBY and had no knowledge of any possible association between OSWALD and RUBY.
ROGER CRAIG, 7711 Piedmont, Apartment B, phone
EVergreen 1-4851, employed as a Deputy Sheriff, Dallas County Sheriff's Department, advised that he was standing in front of the Dallas Sheriff's Office, 505 Main Street, at the time the motorcade of President JOHN F. KENNEDY was approaching the triple underpass. He stated that he heard a shot and ran around the corner onto Houston Street and went through the parking area and briefly searched the area on Elm Street. Shortly after this, approximately 3 or 4 minutes, came back across Elm Street and observed an individual run down the grass area from the direction of the Texas School Book Depository. He heard this individual whistle and a white Rambler station wagon, driven by a Negro male, pulled over to the curb and said
individual got into the care headed toward the Dallas Fort Worth Turnpike.


                CRAIG stated that at 5:18 PM, November 22, 1963,
he was given an opportunity to observe LEE HARVEY OSWALD
in the office of Captain J. W. FRITZ in the Homicide and Robbery Bureau, Dallas Police Department, and that he is
positive that OSWALD is identical with the same individual he observed getting into the Rambler station wagon as
mentioned above.
                ROGER CRAIG, 7711 Piedmont, Apartment B, employed as
Deputy Sheriff, Dallas County Sheriff's Office, was reinterviewed.
Mr. CRAIG stated that about 12:20 p.m., November 22, 1963, he
was standing about 20 feet east of Houston Street on Main Street
in downtown Dallas when he heard a noise which he presumed to be
a gun shot. He states he immediately started west on Main Street
toward Houston Street, and while en route, he heard two additional
noises which he also presumed to be gun shots.


                He stated he crossed Houston Street nd there met a
Dallas city police officer who advised him that the noises he
had heard were in actuality gun shots. He stated he then proceeded
to the Santa fe railroad tracks which run alongside the Texas
Book School Depository building, and while en route there noticed
a car with a woman sitting in it. He stated he immediately took
her to a Mr. LUMMY LEWIS, Dallas County Sheriff's Office, who
took her name and address.


                Mr. CRAIG stated he then went to the southwest corner
of the Texas School Book Depository building and there talked with
a young man and his wife who claimed they had observed a man
through a window of the Texas School Book Depository holding a
rifle about 15 minutes before the parade passed, but assumed he
was a secret service man. CRAIG stated he also took these people
to Mr. LEWIS, who took their names and addresses. CRAIG stated
he then crossed to the south side of Elm Street in front of the
Texas School Book Depository building to see if he could see
marks on the pavement which would indicate that a bullet had
ricocheted.


                He stated that at that time he heard a shrill whistle,
looked up, and saw a man running across the lawn toward Elm
Street coming from direction of Texas School Book Depository
building. He stated he also noticed an automobile traveling
west on Elm, which he feels was a white Nash Rambler station
wagon with a luggage rack on top. He stated he observed the
driver look at the man running down the hill, then observed the
driver stop at the curb. He stated the man on foot got in the
Rambler and they left going west on Elm Street. Mr. CRAIG stated
he did not have the license number, but he feels that is was a 1963
Texas license.

MR. CRAIG described the driver of the automobile as a white male, American, dark-complexion, wearing a light color jacket. Mr. CRAIG stated he had previously described this man as a Negro male, but has since decided that the driver was a white male.


Mr. CRAIG described the man whom he had seen running across the lawn in the following manner:


        White male, height 5’9”, weight 140 pounds, build slender, hair sandy, dress - brown shirt, blue trousers.


Mr. CRAIG stated later the same afternoon he heard that Dallas Police Department had a suspect in the shooting of Officer TIPPITT in Oak Cliff. He stated at this time he called Captain W. FRITZ, Dallas Police Department, gave him the description of the man he had seen crossing the lawn and was advised to view the suspect at Dallas Police Department.


Mr. CRAIG stated he subsequently went to Dallas Police Department and there identifies LEE HARVEY OSWALD is the person he had seen running from the Texas School Book Depository. Mr. CRAIG further stated there is no doubt in his mind that the man he observed running from the Texas School Book Depository and the  person he viewed at Dallas Police Department are identical.
Mr. Robert called this evening and stated that the following depositories were taken today by the designated numbers of the staff.
