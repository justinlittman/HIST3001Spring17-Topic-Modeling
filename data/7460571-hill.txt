Mary and I were wanting to take some pictures of the President so we purposely tried to find a place that was open with no people was around and we had been standing half way down toward the underpass on Elm Street on the south side. We were the only people in that area and were standing right at the curb. The President’s car came around the corner and it was over on our side of the street. Just as Mary Moorman started to take a picture we were looking at the president and Jackie in the back seat and they looking at a little dog between them. Just as the president looked up towards us two shots rang out and I saw the President grab his chest and fall forward across Jackie’s lap and she fell across his back and said “My god he has been shot”. There was an instant pause between the first two shots and the motorcade seemingly halted for an instant and three or four more shots rang out and the motorcade sped away. I thought I saw some men in plain clothes shooting back but everything was such a blur and Mary was pulling on my leg saying “Get down they are shooting”. I looked across the street and up the hill and saw a man running toward the monument and I started running over there. By the time I got up to the railroad tracks some policemen that I suppose were in the motor cade or near by had also arrived and was turning up back and as I came back down the hill Mr. Featherstone of the Times Herald had gotten to Mary and ask her for her picture she had taken of the president, and he brought us to the press room down at the Sheriff’s office and ask to stay.

        In an interview on March 13, 1964, by Special Agents E.J. ROBERTSON and THOMAS T. TRETTIS, JR., Mrs. JEAN LOLLIS HILL stated that after President KENNEDY was shot on November 11, 1963, and after the shooting stopped, she recalled it was then that she noticed a white man wearing a brown raincoat and a hat running west away from the Texas School Book Depository Building in the direction of the railroad tracks. The following investigation was conducted at Dallas, Texas, by Special Agent ROBERTSON in an attempt to establish the identity of this person. 


        On March 27, 1964, a review of the newspaper clippings of the November 22, 1963 issue of the “Dallas Times Herald”, Dallas, Texas, disclosed the following information: Patrolman W.E. PARKER saw workers in the Texas School Book Depository Building pecking on a window from the third floor and pointing to a man wearing horn-rimmed glasses, a plaid coat and raincoat. 


        On April 1, 1964, Patrolman W. E. BARKER, Dallas Police Department advised that the newspaper article was in error as to the location of the people tapping on the window in an attempt to attract his attention to a man standing on Elm Street shortly after the assassination of President KENNEDY. Patrolman BARKER stated the people were in the warehouse east of the Texas School Book Depository Building and the man was standing south of this building on Elm Street between the warehouse and the Dallas County Office Building. He stated the man was taken to the Dallas County Sheriff's Office for questioning and released inasmuch as no basis for any allegations against this person was ever established. He further stated that the man was taken to the Sheriff’s Office some fifteen minutes after the president was shot and could not have possibly been the person observed by JEAN LOLLIS HILL because of the time lag and the fact the man was not wearing and did not posses a hat. 


        On March 30, 1964, Captain P. W. LAWRENCE, Dallas Police Department, advised that a review of his file fails to disclose any information that woud assist in identifying a man waerinf a brown raincoat and hat observed running west away from the Texas School Book Depository Building on November 22, 1963,

Patrolman FOSTER stated he remained at this station until after President KENNEDY was shot and he immediately thereafter surveyed the area where he was stationed and observed the area west of the Texas School Book Depository Building lading toward the railroad tracks, and at no time did he see a white man wearing a brown raincoat and hat. 


        On March 31, 1964, Mr. ROGER CRAIG, Deputy Sheriff, Civil Department, Dallas County Sheriff’s Office, advised he was on Houston Street just south of Elm Street on November 22, 1963, when President KENNEDY was shot. He stated he observed the crowds standing on Houston and Elm Streets and at no time did he observe any person wearing a brown raincoat and hat. 


        On March 31, 1964, Patrolman W. E. BARNETT, Dallas Police Department, advised that he was assigned to work traffic at the intersection of Houston and Elm Streets on November 22, 1963 and arrived at this station at approximately 10:00 AM and remained there until relieved on the afternoon of this date. Patrolman BARNETT stated he was the policeman referred to as being contacted by Mrs. JEAN LOLLIS HILL on that date at the Texas School Book Depository Building and he remembers repairing her cigarette lighter on that date. He stated that he did not know this woman standing on the grassy slope on the south side of Elm Street at the time of the Presidential Motorcade.

an unidentified female stated in a loud tone that the shots had come from the building immediately west of the Texas School Book Depository Building.

                                                                Date 3/17/64
        
        Mrs. JEAN LOLLIS HILL, 9402 Bluffcreek, telephone EV 1-7419, advised that she and a friend, MARY ANN MOORMAN of 2832 Ripplewood, were in the vicinity of Main and Houston Streets on November 22, 1963, for approximately one and one-half hours before the arrival of President JOHN F. KENNEDY and his party. While waiting for the motorcade to arrive at this location, Mrs. HILL and MARY ANN walked around the parkway area near the Texas School Book Depository Building in attempts to determine the best vantage spot for taking photographs of the President. Mrs. HILL said she recalls talking to a uniformed policeman of the Dallas Police Department on the sidewalk near the main entrance to the Texas School Book Depository Building. While conversing with the policeman, Mrs. HILL noticed an automobile circling the area. The windows of the vehicle were covered with cardboard and the name “Honest Joe’s Pawn Shop” was painted on the side of the cat.Mrs. HILL made a remark about the automobile and the policeman told her the driver had permission to drive in the area.  


        Just before the motorcade appeared, MARY ANN MOORMAN and Mrs. HILL were standing on the lawn in the area between Main and Elm Streets opposite the main entrance of the Texas School Book Depositroy Building, Mrs. MOORMAN was taking photographs of the motorcade as it came into view and when the car occupied by President KENNEDY was passing Mrs. HILL, she recalls shouting, “Hey!” She stated that President KENNEDY was looking down when she shouted, and when he turned to look at her a shot rang out and he slumped towards Mrs. KENNEDY. Mrs. HILL heard more shots ring out and saw the hair on the back of President KENNEDY’s head fly up. She stated she thought Mrs, KENNEDY cried out, “Oh, my God, he’s eem shot!” As the President fell forward in his seat Mrs. HILL knew he had been hit by a bullet. Mrs. HILL stated she heard from four to six shots in all and believes they came from a spot just west of the Texas School Book Depository Building. She thought ther was a slight time interval between the first three shots and the remaining shots.

        When the firing stopped, Mrs. HILL noticed that everyone in the vicinity seemed to be in a trance wondering what had happened. Mrs. HILL recalled it was when that she noticed a white man wearing a brown raincoat and hat running west away from the Texas School Book Depository Building in the direction of the railroad tracks, She said she does not know why but she started across the street in an effort “to see who he was”. In doing so she ran in front of the motorcycle escort following the President’s car and was nearly hit by one of the policemen. Mrs, HILL said she lost the man from view when she looked down at what she first thought was a blood spot but later determined to be a red snow cone. She did not get a good look at this man, does not know who he was and never saw him again. She thought the man was of average height and of heavy build. 


        Mrs, HILL then rejoined Mrs, MOORMAN where she had left her, and they started to leave the area. They were stopped by Mr. FEATHERSTONE, a Dallas newspaper man, who took them to the press room at the Dallas County Sheriff’s Office. 


        Mrs, HILL stated that she and MARY ANN MOORMAN were at the Sheriff’s Office foe about two hours and were questioned repeatedly by representatives of the press and various Federal and local law enforcement officers. She said that the Sheriff's Office was a scene of extreme confusion and it was impossible to remember what questions were asked of her by the Secret Service Agents and FBI Agents. She recalled that a man identifying himself as either a Secret Service Agent or FBI Agent asked her what she thought when a bullet hit near her feet raising the dust. Mrs. HILL told him she had no recollection of a bullet hitting near her feet. Mrs. HILL told the agents she heard four to six shots and heard one of the agents make the remark “there were three shots, three bullets, that’s enough for nowM”. She advised that at no time did any Federal Agent or other law enforcement officer attempt to tell her what she should say in regard to the number of shots fired or to force any other opinions upon her.

        Mrs. HILL advised that about a month ago she received a long distance telephone call from MARK LANE, a New York attorney, who questioned her regarding the assassination of President KENNEDY. Mrs. HILL stated that from reading some of LANE’s statements regarding this conversation she determined that LANE had taken some of her remarks out of context, thus changing the meaning of her replies, had not used her full answers to some of the questions, and had misquoted her in this conversation. Mrs. HILL stated that LANE asked her occupation and she replied that she was a housewife, This point was pressed by LANE and Mrs. HILL told him that she did some substitute teaching. LANE told her this was great because teachers make very good witnesses.

Dear Mr. Ranlcin: 


Reference is made to my letter dated April 2, 1964 , which enclosed copies of a memorandum revealing the results of a reinterview with !\Irs. Jean Lollis Hill. 1\Irs. Hill commented she observed a white man, wearing a brown raincoat and a hat, running west away from the Texas School Book Depository Building following the shooting . Mrs . Hill did not closely observe this individual; did not know who he was; and never saw him a~ain. r.Irs . Hill described this man as "average height and heavy build." 


Additional investie;ation has been conducted by this Bureau endeavorinG to identify this individual . This investigation included a review of all available film talcen near the Texas School Book Depository Building following the shooting; a re-examination of the results of all interviews with individuals who were in the vicinity of the shooting; a review of an additional film taken by Mr . Thomas P . Alyea, WFAA- TV newsman; and interviews with Dallas Police Department and Dallas County Sheriff's Office personnel, none· of which revealed the identity of the man described by Mrs . Hill. 


Investigative results appear on pages 43 through 49 in the report of Special Agent Robert P . Gemberling dated April 15 , 1964 . This report was furnished to you by letter dated May 4 , 1964 , and no further action i s being taken in this matter.
