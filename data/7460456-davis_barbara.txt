I hereby wish to make the following statement of my own free will and accord to John J. Ciuffre, who has identified himself to me as a Special Agent of the United States Secret Service.

On November 22, 1963, at approximately a few minutes after 1:00p, I was lying on the bed in my home at 400 East 10th Street, Dallas, with my sister-in-law Virginia Davis and my two children. At the time, I heard a gunshot outside the house. As I got up to go to the front door, I heard another loud gunshot. I opened the front door and also the screen door, at which time I saw a man who I later identified in a police line-up.

The man was on the sidewalk directly in front of me and was shaking shells from a pistol into his hand as he walked.  My front door is approximately 25 to 30 feet from the point where I first saw the man with the gun. The man was walking in a normal manner and did not appear to be excited or in a hurry as he removed the shells from the gun.

The man was walking in an northerly direction and walked across the corner of my property toward Patton Street. At about the time he approached the hedges on the corner of my property closest to the intersection of Patton and E. 10th St., a woman started yelling from across the intersection. I heard the woman yell "he shot him, he killed him". The man sort of glanced up at the woman but continued on at a normal walking speed still taking she;;s out of the gun. The woman that yelled out also pointed out a police car parked almost in front of the driveway of the house next door to mine, I saw the police car and turned and went back into the house and called the police. After making the call to the police, I went back out of the house but the man I had seen walk across my lawn was out of sight.

After the police arrived we searched the area on the side of my house which faces Patton St. and found a spent cartridge case. After the police left, we again searched  this area and found another spent cartridge case, which I later turned over to the police.

I have been given an opportunity to make additions ad corrections on this statement, and it is true to the best of my knowledge and belief.

near where the shooting of Officer J.D. Tippit occurred on that date, and that Benavides was the individual, in fact, that had turned these hulls over to Dallas Police Officer Poe.  One of these hulls was found by Barbara Jeannette Davis of 400 East 10th Street, Dallas Texas, and this hull was turned over to Captain George M. Doughty of the Dallas Police Crime Laboratory. This hull was found in the front yard of Barbara Jeannette Davis of 400 East 10th Street, Dallas, Texas. The other empty hull was found by Virginia Davis of 400 East 10th Street, who resides at that address. Virginia Davis found this empty hull in her front yard and turned it over to Detective C. M. Dhority, Homicide Bureau of the Dallas Police Department, Dallas Texas. Captain Doughty stated that all hulls were received in the Police Crime Laboratory on November 22, 1963.

Captain Doughty state that at the time Lee Harvey Oswald was arrested on November 22, 1963, there actually were six live .38 caliber shells found by Dallas Police Officer Jerry Hi;; in the gun found on Oswald. Two of these live .38 caliber rounds were released to U.S. Secret Service on November 26, 1963 and were at the time in custody of the U.S. Secret Service as far as he knew. Captain Doughty stated that he wanted to point out this fact since only four of the live .38 caliber shells found by Dallas Police Officer Jerry Hill at the time Oswald was arrested by the Dallas Police Partment on November 22, 1963 , were being turned over to the FBI.
