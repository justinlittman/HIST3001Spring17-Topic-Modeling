Deposes and says: 
This day at about 1235 PM I was on the roof of the Termaniel Annex Bldg on the NE Corner when the presidential Motorcade came down Main to Houston, North on Houston and then West on Elm.  The cars had proceeded West on  Elm and was just a short distance from the Tripple underpass, when I saw Gove Connelly slump over.  I did not see the president as his care had gotten out of my view under the underpass.  There was a volley of shots, I think five and then much later, maybe as much as five minutes later another one. I saw one man run towards the passenger cars on the railroad siding after the volley of shots. This man had a white dress shirt, no tie and kahki colored trousers.  His hair appeared to be long and dark and his agility running could be about 25 yrs of ago.  He had something in his hand.  I couldn't be sure but it may have been a head piece.

On [[circled in red pencil]] November 22, 1963, [[circled in red pencil]] Special Agents FRANCIS X. O'NEILL, Jr. and JAMES W. SIBERT witnessed the arrival of the President's body on Air Force #1 at Andrews Air Force Base.  They accompanied the body in the White House motorcade to the Bethesda Naval Hospital, Bethesda, Maryland.  During the course of the subsequent autopsy of the President's body, which was witnessed by afore-mentioned Agents, they spoke to Mr. ROY KELLERMAN, Assistant to the Agent in Charge of the White House Detail of the Secret Service, and Mr. WILLIAM GREER, a Secret Service Agent who was the chauffeur of the President's vehicle at the time of the assination.  Mr. KELLERMAN was also present in the presi-dential vehicle, riding next to the driver at the time of the assassination. 

Mr. KELLERMAN advised that as the ranking Secret Service Agent with the President's party, he was responsible for the presidential security in Dallas.  He stated the advanced security arrangements made for this specific trip were the most stringent and thorough ever employed by the Secret Service for the visit of a President to an American city. 

He advised the presidential vehicle had just completed traversing through a throng of people of approximately 250,000,and he had just breathed a sigh of relief as they were approaching an underpass. 

He advised he heard a shot and immediately turned around, looking past Governor CONNALLY, who was seated directly in back of him, to the President.  He observed the President slump forward and heard him say,  "Get me to a hospital."  Mr. KELLERMAN then heard Mrs. Kennedy say, "Oh, no!", as the President leaned towards her.  He immediately advised the driver to take the President to the nearest hospital. He said that from the time of the shooting to the time they got to the hospital took approximately eight minutes. 

He stated he distinctly heard three shots.  He advised he did not see the Governor get hit, nor did he observe the second bullet hit the President. 

Mr. KELLERMAN said that the President was breathing and gasping for breath on arrival at the hospital, but did not appear to be conscious.

Special Agent GREER advised that he was at the wheel of the presidential limousine which was carrying President KENNEDY and his wife and Governor CONNALLY and his wife as well as Special Agent KELLERMAN.  He advised that the throngs of people were great and that he had just emerged from the congested area of people and was proceeding into an open area of the highway, which a short distance away passed beneath an overpass. 


GREER stated that he first heard what he thought was possibly a motorcycle backfire and glanced around and noticed that the President had evidently been hit.  He thereafter got on the radio and communicated with the other vehicles, stating that they desired to get the President to the hospital immediately. 


GREER stated that at the time that this incident occurred, he was traveling at the rate of 12 miles per hour and following this incident he "floored" the limousine, following the police escort to the hospital.  He estimated that it took him approximately eight minutes to arrive at that location.  GREER stated that they have always been instructed to keep the motorcade moving at a considerable speed inasmuch as a moving car offers a much more difficult target than a vehicle traveling at a very slow speed. He pointed out in this connection that on numerous occasions he has attempted to keep the car moving at a rather fast rate, but in view of the President's popularity and desire to maintain close liaison with the people, he has, on occasion, been instructed by the President to "slow down." 


GREER stated that he has been asking himself if there was anything he could have done to have avoided this incident, but stated that things happened so fast that he could not account for full developments in this matter.

At approximately 12:30 PM on November 22, 1963, a car bearing the President, Mrs. Kennedy, Governor John Connally of Texas and Mrs. Connally, was proceeding west enroute to the Trade Mart Building, 2100 Stemmons Freeway, to a Luncheon sponsored by the Dallas Citizens Council scheduled for 12:30 PM.  The car owned and operated by the Secret Service was driven by Special Agent William R. Greer.  The right front seat was occupied by ASAIC Roy H. Kellerman.  At the foot of Elm Street, at a point approximately 200 feet east of the Houston Street Triple Underpass, on the approach to the Stemmons Freeway, President Kennedy, who was seated on the right rear seat, was shot.  Immediately thereafter Governor Connally, seated in the right jump seat, was shot once.  The President was then shot the second time.  The car carrying the wounded President and the Governor proceeded immediately to the Parkland Memorial Hospital at 5201 Harry Hines Boulevard where the President was pronounced dead by Dr. Kemp Clark, Chief of Neurosurgery at 1pm.  Governor Connally, critically wounded, survived. 


Witnesses identified the source of the shots as the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository Building at 411 Elm Street.  A search of the building disclosed a number of open windows on the south side of the building.  Officers Capt. J.W. Fritz and Detectives R.M. Sims and E.L. Boyd of the Dallas Homicide Division of the Police Department found, in an area on the sixth near an open window on the southeast corner of the building, three expended shells of 6.5 MM caliber rifle ammunition. An immediate search of the room disclosed an Italian Mainlicher-Carcano rifle 6.5 MM with a 4X Scope, hidden among the boxes on opposite side of this room near the staircase.  One loaded shell was found in the chamber of the rifle.

Mr. ROY H. KELLERMAN advised that he is the Assistant Special Agent in Charge of the White House detail, United States Secret Service.  He stated he has been an agent with that organization since December 19, 1941. 


On November 22, 1963, he was the senior Secret Service agent assigned to President KENNEDY in Dallas, Texas. 


He advised that Air Force Plane Number One arrived at Love Field, Dallas, Texas, on the morning of November 22, 1963.  Upon departing from the plane, the President was met by Vice President JOHNSON.


Prior to getting into the White House Limousine which was waiting for the President, the President and the First Lady went to the fence separating the apron from the taxi area.  He shook hands with many of the people there. 


He then came to the limousine.  Protocol dictates that the President be seated in the right rear of the vehicle.  The President seated himself in this position and the First Lady sat next to him.  Governor JOHN CONNALLY and his wife then entered the vehicle.  Mrs. CONNALLY seated herself in the jump seat of the vehicle in front of Mrs. KENNEDY and the Governor was seated in the jump seat in front of the President.  


Special Agent WILLIAM GREER of the United States Secret Service was the driver of the Presidential vehicle.  Mr. KELLERMAN advised that he sat in the front of Governor CONNALLY, next to agent GREER. 


He advised that the President's Car can be covered with a bullet proof bubble, however, it is  not used on too many occasions.  It was not used on this occasion.

The President's seat can be adjusted to a height of approximately ten inches.  The only person who can adjust this seat is the President himself.  This seat was not elevated on November 22. 


KELLERMAN advised that preceding the Presidential vehicle out of Love Field, there was what is known as a lead car.  This car belonged to the Dallas City Police Department, in which were Special Agent WINSTON LAWSON, United States Secret Service who was in charge of the Advanced Security in Dallas for the Presidential visit. This car is equipped with a portable radio connected with the Presidential car.  The vehicle also had contact with the Dallas City Police Department.  In addition to the lead vehicle, along side the lead vehicle and along side the Presidential car.  In the rear of the Presidential car was another White House Limousine containing Secret Service Agents.  These agents walked along side the Presidential vehicle until the vehicle left the area of the apron.  The agents then got into their car and followed immediately in back of the President. 


KELLERMAN went on to say that the vehicle passed through the center of town doing the normal speed which was adjusted by the number of people in the crowd and on the streets through which the Presidential vehicle passed.  The vehicle went through the center of town on a street, which name KELLERMAN did not recall.  Towards the end of town, the vehicle came to a sharp right turn in the street.  Few people were on either side at this time.  In a manner of a block, the road veered to the left. There were extremely  few people on either side of the road at this point.  The vehicle was still going at the normal speed which KELLERMAN estimated to be approximately 15 miles per hour.  The Secret Service car following the Presidential vehicle was "tight close at hand".

KELLERMAN advised he does not recall passing the Texas State Book Repository Building.  He advised the vehicle appeared to be going down a small decline at which time everybody in the car was seated. 


KELLERMAN said he heard a noise like a firecracker


At this point, KELLERMAN advised he had been in almost daily contact for the past three years, with the President, and said he could pick his voice out from any group of people. 


Upon hearing a noise like a firecracker, he distinctly and positively heard the President say "My God, I've been hit".  KELLERMAN advised he immediately turned his head to the left rear and almost instantaneously heard two additional shots. 


Upon turning his head to the left, he observed President KENNEDY with his left hand in back of him appearing to be reaching to a point on his right shoulder. The President fell on Mrs. KENNEDY's lap.  She stated "My God, what are they doing to you?"  Governor CONNALLY never said a word.  Through the corner of his eye, he noticed that Governor CONNALLY appeared to be falling back face up in the lap of his wife.  KELLERMAN stated he immediately turned around and advised Mr. GREER, "Get going, we've been hit".  KELLERMAN had the microphone in his hand and radioed to LAWSON stating "we've been hit, lead us to a hospital immediately.  Tell the police to escort us as fast as they can."  He turned back again to the rear of the vehicle and saw Special Agent CLINTON HILL of the Secret Service climbing up on the back of the vehicle.  HILL had been one of the agents in the follow-up vehicle immediately in back of the Presidential car. KELLERMAN stated that at this time, to the best of his recollection, the President was lying in the lap of Mrs. KENNEDY.  He observed that Governor CONNALLY was now lying with his head up in the lap of Mrs. CONNALLY.  KELLERMAN advised he asked agent HILL if he was all right and told him to hang on.

The Presidential vehicle arrived at the Parkland Memorial Hospital in a matter of minutes.  KELLERMAN stated he immediately jumped out of the vehicle and told hospital personnel to bring two stretchers.  As the stretchers came out, KELLERMAN and GREER opened the back door of the Presidential Car.  Governor CONNALLY's eyes were open. He was told by KELLERMAN "Governor CONNALLY, everything is going to be all right".  The Governor nodded his head in the affirmative.  Three persons got into the vehicle at this time and lifted the Governor onto the first stretcher. They then got back in the Presidential car and with the assistance of KELLERMAN and GREER lifted the President from the lap of Mrs. KENNEDY and put him on the second stretcher.  He described the President's head as lying partially on the lap of Mrs. KENNEDY and back against the rear cushion of the back seat.  According to KELLERMAN, the President at this time was alive because he noticed that he was breathing.  KELLERMAN advised he did not notice the extent of the injury to the President although he noticed a wound in the back of his head.  The President's eyes were shut.


KELLERMAN advised the President was immediately taken into the Emergency Ward where several doctors began working with a feverish activity on Mr. KENNEDY to save his life.  Several monents late, KELLERMAN stated the President died. 


Mr. KELLERMAN said that from the time of this incident he has been going over in his mind the entire activity concerning the assassination of the President. The information that he has furnished to interviewing agents is factual and to the best of his knowledge is everything that occurred on November 22, 1963.

Mr. WILLIAM ROBERT GREER, Special Agent, U.S. Secret Service, assigned to the White House detail, who resides at 9513 Sheridan, Seabrook Acres, Maryland, was interviewed at  The Secret Service Office in the White House and furnished the following information. 


GREER serves in the capacity of Senior Agent assigned to driving the President's vehicle in motorcades.  Two of the White House vehicles to be used in the Dallas Presidential Visit had been flown into Love Field, Dallas, Texas in a C-130 type aircraft on the morning of November 22, 1963.  GREER was in company with the Presidential party which arrived at Love Field in Air Force I, a jet used by President KENNEDY.  On the President's arrival, all of the vehicles to be used in the motor-cade were in position on the ramp and soon after the party had landed, they took their positions in the awaiting cars  and the motorcade departed for downtown Dallas. 


It is normal procedure for the vehicle bearing the President to be the second car in the motorcade, which follows the lead car generally occupied by local police and the Secret Service Agent who had conducted the advance survey of the route prior to the date of the President's visit.  In the Dallas parade GREER was driving the seven-passenger Lincoln Continental "bubble-top" and as customary,  President KENNEDY was sitting on the right of the rear seat.  Mrs. KENNEDY was seated to his left, Governor CONNALLY was seated directly in front of the President on the "jump-seat" which folds down on the floor between the front and rear seats.  Mrs. CONNALLY was seated to the left of her husband on the "jump-seat" and Special Agent ROY H. KELLERMAN, of the Secret Service, was seated to the right of GREER.  As this vehicle departed from the ramp at Love Field, additional Secret Service Agents were on foot surrounding the vehicle until it emerged from the crowded area. 


The lead car, which was directly in front of the Presidential vehicle, was a police vehicle occupied by members of the City of Dallas Police Department and Secret Service Agent LAWSON, who had conducted the advanced survey of the Dallas route. GREER estimated that the motorcade was traveling at a speed of 15 to 20 miles per hour down the main thoroughfare, which was lined on both sides by vast crowds of people and many additional

persons were observing the motorcade through open windows in office buildings along both sides of the route.  The weather was balmy and clear and many of the people were without coats. 


The procession made a right turn, facing in the direction of the Book Depository Building and then a left turn, bringing the motorcade in front of this building which was then on the right.  The same speed was maintained as the motorcade passed in front of this building and GREER estimates that he had crossed the center line of the building when he heard a noise which sounded like a motorcycle backfire.  On hearing this noise he glanced to his right toward KELLERMAN and out of the corner of his eye noticed that the Governor appeared to be falling toward his wife.  He thereafter recalls hearing some type of outcry after which KELLERMAN said, "Let's get out of here."  He further related that at the time of hearing the sound he was starting down an incline which passes beneath a railroad crossing and after passing under this viaduct, he closed in on the lead car and yelled to the occupants and a nearby police motorcyclist, "Hospital, Hospital!"  The lead car sped in the direction of Parkland Hospital closely followed by GREER, who at times floored the accelerator. 


On arrival at the hospital, GREER and KELLERMAN jumped out of the vehicle and first removed Governor CONNALLY, who was placed on a stretcher.  CONNALLY was removed first in order to push the "jump seat" forward thus permitting removal of the President.  GREER recalls helping take the President's stretcher into the emergency operating room.  It is his recollection that the President was breathing when removed from the vehicle and transported into this room. 


GREER stated that since he was occupied with driving the vehicle, he did not have much opportunity to observe the activity occurring in the rear of the vehicle after the President and Governor were shot. 


The following description of Agent GREER was obtained through observation and interview:

SA JOHN JOE HOWLETT, U.S. Secret Service, Dallas, advised that with the aid of a surveyor and through the use of 8 millimeter movie films depicting President JOHN F. KENNEDY being struck by assassin's bullets on November 22, 1963, HOWLETT was able to ascertain that the distance from the window ledge of the farthest window to the east in the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository Building, 411 Elm Street, to where the President was struck the first time in the neck was approximately 170 feet.  He stated this distance would be accurate within two of three feet.  The distance from the same window ledge to the spot where President KENNEDY was struck in the head by the assassin's bullet was approximately 260 feet.  Mr. HOWLETT stated that Secret Service Agents, using the 8 millimeter film had been unable to ascertain the exact location where Governor JOHN B. CONNALLY was struck. 


SA HOWLETT advised that it had been ascertained from the movies that President KENNEDY was struck with the first and third shots fired by the assassin, while Gov. CONNALLY was struck with the second shot.  SA HOWLETT stated thewindow referred to above was the one from which the shots were fired and faces south.

FRANCES GAYLE NEWMAN, 718 W. Clarendon Street, advised that at the time President KENNEDY was assassinated and Governor CONNALLY was wounded she was standing on the north curb of Elm Street between the triple underpass and Houston Street.  Also standing there were her two children, ages 2 and 4,  and her husband,  WILLIAM EUGENE NEWMAN,  Jr. She estimated that when the limousine bearing the Presidential party was about 50 feet from them she heard rifle / reports and the the President seemed to rise up in his seat.  A few seconds later she heard another shot and saw that the President had been hit in the head because she saw blood flowing from his body.  She said a man had been standing back of them on a pedestal near an arcade taking photographs and there were a couple of people east of them on the north side of Elm Street. 


She stated that after the President was shot officers and probably Secret Service men started running toward the arcade near the point where the photographer was taking his pictures.  She believed there were first two shots in succession, a pause, then another shot was fired which struck the President.  She said the limousine was a three seated one carrying Governor CONNALLY and his wife in the middle seat and the President and Mrs. KENNEDY in the back seat. She did not notice the occupants of the front seat as she had her eyes on the President whom she had come to see.  After the shots were fired, she and her husband each grabbed a child and lay down on the grass fearing that they might be hit by gunfire.  She noticed that Governor CONNALLY seemed to be lying down in the front seat holding his stomach when he passed directly in front of them. She was taken with her husband to the WFAA Studio where they waited a short/ time, and after the announcement came that the President was deceased, she and her husband were interviewed.  They later made statements to Deputy Sheriffs concerning their eye-witness account of the assassination of the President and the wounding of Governor CONNALLY. 


The shots were fired at the President and Governor CONNALLY about 12:30 p.m. on November 22, 1963.  She said she did not see LEE HARVEY OSWALD during that time.

WILLIAM EUGENE NEWMAN, Jr., 718 W. Clarendon, who is an unemployed electrician, advised that at the time of the assassination of President KENNEDY he and his wife, GAYLE, and their two children were standing on the north side of Elm Street about mid-way between Houston Street and the triple overpass.  There were very few people on that side of the street.  One man was standing on a pedestal near an arcade to the rear of them taking movies and he believed that two women were a few steps up the street from him.  He believed that when the President's car was approximately 50 feet from him proceeding in a westerly direction on Elm Street he heard the first shots fired. It was his belief that two shots were fired in rapid succession which he thought at the time was a firecracker. 


The car was proceeding toward him and it seemed that the President's arms went up and that he raised up in his seat and started to look around.  The car proceeded to a point about even with him and he could see Governor JOHN CONNALLY was holding his stomach. About that time another shot was fired which he estimated was ten seconds after the first shot was fired.  At that time he heard the bullet strike the President and saw flesh fly from the President's head.  He noticed that Governor CONNALLY was lying back in the seat of the car and that his eyes "were real big."  NEWMAN first though the President and Governor were playing some kind of a game and suddenly realized that had been shot and that he was perhaps in the line of fire because officers started running toward the arcade directly back of him and his wife.  He grabbed one child and his wife the other.  They both lay down on the grass until after the procession passed.  He stated he did not see any blood on Governor CONNALLY or President KENNEDY and that the limousine in which they were riding was a three seated limousine with Governor CONNALLY and President KENNEDY sitting on the side nearest him and the side nearest the Texas School Book Depository building from where he learned later the shots had been fired.  President KENNEDY was seated in the back seat with his wife and Governor CONNALLY and his wife were in the middle seat of the limousine.  He could not recall any of the bullets hitting the car but he said the report of the rifle was very loud and clear.  He was later taken to the offices of WFAA Studio in Dallas and they interviewed him concerning his eye-witness account of the assassination of the President and the shooting of Governor CONNALLY. 


He was also interviewed by Deputy Sheriffs and gave a statement as to what happened.  He recalled that when the President

was shot Mrs. KENNEDY seemed to grab him and pull him toward her. He was positive this occurred because when all shots were fired at the President he had his eyes directly on him.  He could not state whether Mrs. CONNALLY was helping her husband or not but he seemed to be lying down when he passed them. 


He said the President was hit on the right side of the head with the third shot and he heard the thud when the bullet struck the President.  He did not see any rifle in the possession of anyone whom he thought might be responsible for the shooting. He has seen pictures of LEE HARVEY OSWALD on television and stated he had never seen him insofar as he knows. 


The assassination of the President occurred about 12:30 p.m. on November 22, 1963.

ABRAHAM ZAPRUDER, 3909 Marquette Street, Dallas, advised that on November 22, 1963, he was standing in the park area north of Elm Street and just west of the inter-section of Elm and Houston Streets.  He had taken this posi-tion in order to take 8 millimeter movie film of the President and the Presidential motorcade as it passed by him.  He stated he had with him a Bell and Howell 8 millimeter zoom-lens camera, which was either a 1962 or 1963 model.  He advised he had loaded this camera previously with a 25-foot roll of 16 milli-meter film, which in effect affords 50 feet of 8 millimeter film.  He had shot the first 25 feet earlier and had reversed the roll and shot a few feet on November 22, 1963, at the park area of some girls who work in his office, prior to the arrival of the Presidential motorcade.  He stated his camera was fully wound, was set, manually, on maximum zoom-lens.  The camera was set to take normal speed movie film or 24 frames per second.  The control buttons for the zoom-lens were not touched once he started taking photographs of the Presidential motorcade. 


ZAPRUDER stated that he first picked up the motorcade as it made the turn on to Elm Street from Houston Street.  The motorcade then passed behind a street directional sign and from that point on until it disappeared from sight to his right, or the west, he was taking moving pictures of the President's car.  He stated he had started taking pictures prior to the first shot being fired and continued taking pictures until the motorcade disappeared to his right.  ZAPRUDER advised he could not recall but having heard only two shots and, also, stated that he knew that from watching through the viewfinder that the President had been hit.  He stated he took the exposed film immediately to the Jamieson Film Company on Bryan Street, Dallas, and stayed with the film through its entire processing. He had the original print and three copies made.  The film was in color.  The original is on 16 millimeter film, and according to Mr. ZAPRUDER is much clearer than those appearing on 8 mill-meter film.  He subsequently turned over two copies to the United States Secret Service and sold the original and one copy to [[underlined]] Life Magazine [[underlined]].

BARRETT his Bell and Howell 8 millimeter zoom-lens camera described above.  He requested that the camera be returned to him after it had served its use to the FBI.  He advised this camera had been in the hands of the United States Secret Service Agents on December 3, 1963, as they claimed they wanted to do some checking of it.  He, also, stated he had received a call from the Bell and Howell Company who stated they wanted to place the camera in their archives and would replace the camera with a new one.

B. [[underlined]] Patrolman Tippit Killed [[underlined]]
               An immediate investigation was launched to identify and apprehend the President's assailant.  Within the hour, at approximately 1:15 p.m., Dallas Patrolman J. D. Tippit, presumably acting on the basis of a broadcast over the police radio, stopped a possible suspect on Tenth Street just east of Patton Street.  The man drew a gun and shot Patrolman Tippit three times, resulting in the officer's death. (Exhibit 1)  The assailant, subsequently identified as Lee Harvey Oswald, was apprehended in the Texas Theater, 231 West Jefferson Boulevard.  (Exhibit 1) In the course of the apprehension, which took place about 2:00 p.m., he resisted violently and attempted to shoot still another police officer. 
              Identified as an employee in the building from which the shots were fired at President Kennedy and Governor Connally, Oswald became a prime suspect in the assassination of President Kennedy. However, when interviewed following his apprehension, Oswald denied any knowledge of or participation in the assassination of the President or Tippit's murder. 
              Nevertheless, evidence developed in the investigation points conclusively to the assassination of President Kennedy by Lee Harvey Oswald, avowed Marxist, a former defector to the Soviet Union and the self-appointed Secretary of the New Orleans Chapter of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee, a pro-Castro organization.

after riding a block or two he left the bus due to the traffic congestion and took a city cab to his apartment on North Beckley Street.  Oswald stated that after arriving at his apartment he changed his shirt and trousers because they were dirty. 
     Oswald denied that he had kept a rifle in the garage at Mrs. Paine's residence in Irving, Texas, but stated he did have some property, including two sea bags and a couple of suitcases, stored there. 
     Oswald denied that he was a member of the Communist Party and stated he had nothing against President Kennedy personally.  He stated, however, that in view of the charges against him he did not desire to discuss the matter further.  Oswald denied shooting President Kennedy and added that he was not aware of the fact that Governor John Connally had also been shot. 
     The photograph of Oswald holding a rifle and wearing a holstered pistol was exhibited to him and Oswald stated he would not discuss the photograph.  Oswald stated the head of the individual in the photograph could be his but it was entirely possible that the police department had superimposed this part of the photograph over the body of someone else.

On December 3, 1963, SA CHARLES T. BROWN, JR., tele-phonically contacted Mr. JOHN MARTIN, Superintendent of Safety, Room 517, Houston Street Annex Post Office, telephone RI 9-3181. Mr. MARTIN was contacted at his home, telephone DI 8-3546. MARTIN advised on November 22, 1963, he took some 8 mm color movies of the Presidential Motorcade.  The movies were made while MARTIN was standing on Houston Street, adjacent to the Dallas County Sheriff's Office Building.   MARTIN said there is a possibility he obtained movies of the Texas School Book Depository Building.


MARTIN was contacted by representatives of [[underlined]]Life[[underlined]] Magazine, and the film was turned over to Mrs. PAT SWANK, [[underlined]]Life[[underlined]] Magazine representative in Dallas, telephone LA 6-1398.  The film was eventually placed in the hands of a Mr. BILLINGSLEY, representative of [[underlined]]Life[[underlined]] Magazine, Room 1106, Adolphus Hotel.  MARTIN believes the films have been forwarded to [[underlined]]Life[[underlined]] Magazine Headquarters, New York City.

[[underlined]] PROTECTIVE RESEARCH [[underlined]]


Notice of the proposed Presidential trip to Dallas was furnished to the Protective Research Section on November 8, 1963.  The indices were searched, and no active subjects were of record.  No subsequent infor-mation was received from the Protective Research Section of any subject requiring attention. 


A list of catering personnel, wash room attendants, and the organist who might be in close proximity to the President at the Trade Mart and a list of persons who would serve the food were forwarded to the Protec-tive Research Section by SAIC Sorrels, Dallas Office, on November 18, 1963. 


On November 21, 1963, at a police meeting in Chief Curry's Office, I was given a copy of a locally distributed circular (Attachment #11) describing President Kennedy as being wanted for treason.  The distributors of the circular were not known to the police.  SAIC Sorrels has forwarded copies of this circular to the Protective Research Section for record purposes and an investigation is being conducted. 


Informants of the Right Wing Movement were interviewed SA Howlett, Dallas Office, to identify any possible trouble makers.  Motion-picture films of the assault on Ambassador Stevenson which occurred in Dallas were viewed with members of the Criminal Intelligence Division of the Dallas Police Department at Station KLRD TV-Radio.  Still photographs were obtained of persons involved in this incident.  SA Howlett was on duty at check point entrance at Trade Mart with copies of these pictures. Detectives in the lobby and luncheon area were also furnished copies of these photographs and were screening for these individuals.  A number of individuals who resembled those in these photographs were placed under surveillance at the Trade Mart. 


At approximately 12:30 p.m. November 22, 1963, President Kennedy and Governor Connally of Texas were struck by gunfire while riding in SS-100-X during a motorcade to the Trade Mart.  The President died at Parkland Hospital, Dallas, Texas, at 1:00 p.m. CST, November 22, 1963.

Statement of Special Agent Clinton J. Hill, United States Secret Service, concerning his activities and official duties on November 22, 1963. Statement dated November 30, 1963. 


I, Clinton J. Hill, Special Agent, United States Secret Service, arrived at Love Field, Dallas, Texas, at 11:40 a.m. on November 22, 1963, from Fort Worth, Texas, aboard Air Force No. One (USAF #26000) with President and Mrs. John F. Kennedy.  President and Mrs. Kennedy debarked the aircraft first from the rear ramp followed by Governor and Mrs. John Connally and by three or four Congressmen and Senators, and then myself and ASAIC Roy H. Kellerman. 


Upon alighting, President and Mrs. Kennedy were greeted by a small reception committee and Mrs. Kennedy were greeted by a small reception committee and Mrs. Kennedy was presented a bouquet of red roses.  I ran over to the Secret Service Follow-up car immediately upon my arrival and placed my topcoat and a small folder containing information on this Dallas stop of the Texas trip on the floor of the car.  I then went back to where the President and Mrs. Kennedy were greeting an elderly lady in a wheel chair. 


The general public was restricted from the ramp area of Love Field by a permanent chain-link fence.  There were a number of photographers and corres-pondents on the ramp area covering the arrival. 


The President noticed the large number of people being restrained by the fence and walked over to the crowd and began shaking hands.  He moved from his right to the left down the fence.  Mrs. Kennedy accompanied him.  I remained very close to Mrs. Kennedy observing the outstretched hands of well-wishers to make sure no weapons were extended toward Mrs. Kennedy and that nothing was handed to her.  I accompanied Mrs. Kennedy behind the President along the fence and then to the Presidential automobile which was waiting to take President and Mrs. Kennedy and Governor and Mrs. John Connally to the Trade Mart for a luncheon, after a 45-minute motorcade through downtown Dallas. 


President and Mrs. Kennedy entered the automobile with the President getting into the right rear seat and Mrs. Kennedy into the left rear seat.  Mrs. Connally got into the left jump seat and Governor Connally into the right jump seat.  SA William Greer was driving the automobile with ASAIC Roy H. Kellerman in the right front seat.  I went to the left rear side of the Presidential automobile and stood on the airport ramp along side where Mrs. Kennedy was sitting. 


As the Presidential automobile began to move forward at 11:55 a.m.  I walked along side of the left rear of the automobile for about 150 feet, and since there were no people at all on the airport ramp I went back to the automobile immediately behind the Presidential Automobile and mounted the forward portion of the left running board.

SA Sam Kinney was driving this Secret Service Follow-up car which was a 1955 Cadillac 9-passenger convertible specifically outfitted for use by the Secret Service.  ATSAIC Emory Roberts was sitting in the right front seat and operating the two-way radio.  SA John Ready was on the forward portion of the right hand running board; SA William McIntyre on the rear portion of the left hand running board; SA Paul E. Landis on the rear portion of the right hand running board; Mr. Kenneth O'Donnell, Presidential Appointment Secretary, was seated on the left side of the second seat; Mr. Dave Powers, Presidential Receptionist, was seated on the right side of the second seat; SA George Hickey was seated on the left side of the third seat; and SA Glen Bennett was seated on the right side of the third seat. 


The Presidential Follow-up car was followed by a 1964 Lincoln 4-door convertible occupied by Vice-President and Mrs. Lyndon Johnson, Senator Ralph Yarborough, with ASAIC Rufus Youngblood in the right front seat.  This automobile was followed by a Secret Service follow-up car for the Vice President, and then came automobiles occupied by photographers, correspondents, Senators and Congress-men. 


Preceding the Presidential automobile was a Dallas Police Department Lead car in which SA Winston Lawson of the Secret Service was riding.  Police motor-cycles preceded and flanked the motorcade.  There were two police motorcycles on the left side of the President's Secret Service follow-up car running abreast of one another between the automobile and the crowd of people. 


My instructions for Dallas were to work the left rear of the Presidential automobile and remain in close proximity to Mrs. John. F. Kennedy at all times. The agent assigned to work the left rear of the Presidential automobile rides on the forward position of the left hand running board of the Secret Service follow-up car and only moves forward to walk alongsidethe [[sic]] Presidential automobile when it slows to such a pace that people can readily approach the auto on foot.  If the crowd is very heavy, but the automobile is running at a rather rapid speed, the agent rides on the left rear of the Presidential automobile on a step specifi-cally designed for that purpose. 


As the motorcade moved from Love Field through downtown Dallas toward the Trade Mart, there were four (4) occasions before we reached the end of Main Street where I moved from the forward portion of the left running board of the follow-up car to the rear step of the Presidential automobile.  I did this because the motorcycles that were along the left hand side of the follow-up car were unable to move up alongside the President's car due to the crowd surging into the street. The motorcycles were forced to drop back and so I jumped from the Follow-up car and mounted the President's car.  I remained in this position until the crowd thinned and was away from the President's automobile, allowing the motorcycles to once again move up alongside of the automobile.  When we approached the end of Main Street the crowd was noticeably less dense than had been the case prior to that point.

The motorcade made a right hand turn onto Elm Street.  I was on the forward portion of the left running board of the follow-up car.  The motorcade made a left hand turn from Elm Street toward an underpass.  We were traveling about 12 to 15 miles per hour.  On the left hand side was a grass area with a few people scattered along it observing the motorcade passing, and I was visually scanning these people when I heard a noise similar to a firecracker.  The sound came from my right rear and I immediately moved my head in that direction.  In so doing, my eyes had to cross the Presidential automobile and I saw the President hunch forward and then slump to his left.  I jumped from the Follow-up car and ran toward the Presidential automobile.  I heard a second firecracker type noise but it had a different sound—like the sound of shooting a revolver into something hard.  I saw the President slump more toward his left. 


I jumped onto the left rear step of the President automobile.  Mrs. Kennedy shouted, "They've shot his head off;" then turned and raised out of her seat as if she were reaching to her right rear toward the back of the car for something that had blown out.  I forced her back into her seat and placed my body over President and Mrs. Kennedy.  SA Greer had, as I jumped onto the Presidential automobile, accelerated the Presidential automobile forward.  I heard ASAIC Kellerman call SA Lawson on the two-way radio and say, "To the nearest hospital, quick."  I shouted as loud as I could at the Lead car, "To the hospital, to the hospital."


As I lay over the top of the back seat I noticed a portion of the President's head on the right rear side was missing and he was bleeding profusely. Part of his brain was gone.  I saw a part of his skull with hair on it lying in the seat.  The time of the shooting was approximately 12:30 p.m., Dallas time.  I looked forward to the jump seats and noticed Governor Connally's chest was covered with blood and he was slumped to his left and partially covered up by his wife. I had not realized until this point that the Governor had been shot. 


When we arrived at Parkland Memorial Hospital, Dallas, I jumped off the Presidential automobile, removed my suit coat and covered the President's head and upper chest with it.  I assisted in lifting the President from the rear seat of the automobile onto a wheel type stretcher and accompanied the President and Mrs. Kennedy into the Emergency Room.  Governor Connally had been placed in an Emergency Room across the hall. 


I exited the Emergency Room almost immediately because of the large number of doctors and nurses in the room, which was quite small.  I asked a nurse standing outside of the Emergency Room in which the President was lying to please have everyone except those Medical Staff members necessary leave the emergency ward.  She immediately began screening medical staff members. 


I asked for the nearest telephone.  ASAIC Kellerman exited the Emergency Room and told me to contact the White House in Washington and to keep the line open continually.  I asked SA Lawson for the telephone number of the Dallas White

House switchboard and he gave it to me.  I dialed the Dallas White House operator and told him to connect me with the White House in Washington and to keep this line open continuously.  He did so. 


ASAIC Kellerman came out of the Emergency Room again and took the telephone and asked for SAIC Gerald A. Behn, Secret Service, The White House, Washington.  This was approximately 12:39 p.m.  Kellerman told Behn that there had been a double tragedy; that the President and Governor Connally had both been shot and that I would keep him advised.  I took over the telephone and told Mr. Behn that the situation was extremely critical.  The operator cut into the line and said The Attorney General wanted to talk to me.  He asked me what the situation was and I advised him that the President had been injured very seriously and that I would keep him advised as to his condition. 


Mr. Kellerman came back out of the Emergency Room and said, "Clint, tell Gerry that this is not for release and not official, but the man in dead." I told that to Mr. Behn and then requested that he immediately contact the Attorney General and other members of the President's family so that he could advise them of the situation rather than having them hear it over some news media. 


I then received a request from Mr. O'Donnell to obtain a casket immediately so that we could transport the body back to Washington, D.C., as quickly as possible.  I contacted the Hospital Administrator and asked for the name of the nearest mortuary.  He said it would be O'Neil, Inc.  I telephoned them and identified myself and requested that they bring the best casket immediately available at the mortuary to the Parkland Memorial Hospital Emergency Entrance and deliver it to me.  The casket arrived in about twenty minutes at approximately 1:40 p.m.  We wheeled it immediately into the Emergency Room where the President's body lay. 


I advised the Air Force Aide that we wanted Air Force No. One moved to a different location at Love Field and to have it secured completely away from the view of the General Public.  I requested that no press be admitted to the area in which Air Force One was to be placed.  I requested SA David Grant to notify the Dallas Police that we did not want to use the same entrance to Love Field that previously had been planned.  I then went with the Hospital Adminis-trator and checked the shortest and most direct route from the Emergency Room to the emergency platform where the O'Neil hearse was waiting.  I advised ATSAIC Stuart Stout of the route and requested that it be cleared of personnel. 


The President's body, accompanied by Mrs. Kennedy, exited the Emergency Room at approximately 1:58 p.m. and proceeded to the emergency entrance platform. The casket was placed in the back of the O'Neil, Inc., hearse and Mrs. Kennedy, Admiral George Burkley (the President's Physician), and I entered the back of the hearse with the casket.  SA Andrew Berger drove the hearse; ATSAIC Stuart Stout rode in the center front seat and ASAIC Kellerman rode in the right front seat.

We departed Parkland Memorial Hospital at 2:04 p.m.  SA Lawson rode in the Dallas Police Department Lead Car.  A Secret Service follow-up car followed immediately behind the hearse.  The motorcade arrived at Air Force One, Love Field, at 2:14 p.m. 


At 2:18 p.m. the casket was placed aboard Air Force One with Mrs. Kennedy accompanying it.  The casket was situated in the left rear corner of the aircraft where four seats had been removed.  Mrs. Kennedy sat in one of the two seats immediately across the aisle from the casket. 


The aircraft could no immediately depart because Vice-President Johnson had to be sworn in as the 36th President of the United States and it was necessary to wait for a Judge to arrive to do this.  All personnel on Air Force One including Mrs. Kennedy were requested to witness the swearing in ceremony which took place in the President Compartment of Air Force One at 2:38 p.m.  I also attended. 


I departed Love Field, Dallas, aboard Air Force One at 2:47 p.m. en route to Andrews Air Force Base, Maryland.  I arrived at Andrews Air Force Base at 5:58 p.m.  I assisted in moving the casket bearing the President's body from Air Force One to a U. S. Navy ambulance.  Mrs. Kennedy got in the back of the ambulance with the casket as did Attorney General Robert Kennedy, who had joined Mrs. Kennedy aboard Air Force One upon arrival at Andrews Air Force Base.  General Godrey McHugh also rode in the back of the ambulance.  The ambulance was driven by SA Greer with ASAIC Kellerman, SA Landis, and Admiral Buckley riding in the front seat.  I followed in the car immediately behind the ambulance with Dr. John W. Walsh, Dave Powers, Kenneth O'Donnell and Larry O'Brien. 


The motorcade departed Andrews Air Force Base for Bethesda Naval Hospital, Bethesda, Maryland, at 6:10 p.m.  We were escorted by motorcycle police officers. The motorcade arrived Bethesda Naval Hospital at 6:55 p.m.  Mrs. Kennedy, the Attorney General, SA Landis and I went immediately inside and via elevator to the 17th Floor of the hospital, the location of the Presidential Suite.  Members of the immediate family and close friends were waiting in the suite. 


The President's body was taken to the morgue at the hospital,accompanied by ASAIC Kellerman, SA Greer, and Admiral Burkley, for an autopsy.  SA Landis and I secured the 17th Floor of the hospital and remained there with Mrs. Kennedy.  We established a communications system with the White House and handled all telephone calls both incoming and outgoing, screening each and every call.  Any person attempting to reach the 17th Floor was also screened. 


At approximately 2:45 a.m., November 23, I was requested by ASAIC Kellerman to come to the morgue to once again view the body.  When I arrived the autopsy had been completed at ASAIC Kellerman, SA Greer, General McHugh and I viewed the wounds.  I observed a wound about six inches down from the neckline on the back just to the right of the spinal column.  I observed another wound on

                    On April 14, 1964, a conference was held to determine which frames in the Zapruder film portray the instants at which the first and second bullets struck. 


                    Present were:  Commander James J. Humes, Director of Laboratories of the Naval Medical School, Bethesda, Maryland; Commander J. Thornton Boswell, Chief Pathologist, Naval Medical School, Bethesda; Lt. Col. Pierre A. Finck, Chief of Wound Ballistics Pathology Branch,  Armed Forces Institute of Pathology; Dr. F. W. Light, Jr., Deputy Chief of the Biophysics Division at Edgewood Arsenal, Maryland, and Chief of the Wound Assessment Branch of the Biophysics Division; Dr. Olivier, Chief of the Wound Ballistics Branch of the Biophysics Division at Edgewood Arsenal; Messrs. Malley, Gauthier, Shaneyfelt, and two other unidentified agents of the FBI; Messrs. Kelley and Howlett of the Secret Service; and Messrs. Redlich, Specter, and Eisenberg of the Commission staff. 


                  A screening was held of the Zapruder film and of slides prepared by LIFE from the film.  Each slide corres-ponded with a separate frame of film, beginning with frame 171. The consensus of the meeting was as follows: 


                  (a) The President had been definitely hit by frames 224-225, when he emerges from behind a sign with his hands clutching at his throat. 


                  (b) The reaction shown in frames 224-25 may have started at an earlier point--possibly as early as frame 199 (when there appears to be some jerkiness in his movement) or, with a higher degree of possibility, at frames 204-06 (where his right elbow appears to be raised to an artificially high position). 


                  (c) If the reaction did not begin at 199 or 204-06, it probably began during the range of frames during which the President is hidden from Zapruder's camera by a sign, namely, frames 215-24.

               (d) The President may have been struck by the first bullet as much as two seconds before any visible reaction began.  In all likelihood, however, the maximum delay between impact and reaction would be under one second, and it is possible that the reaction was instantaneous.  Putting this in terms of frames, the President may have been struck as much as 36 frames before any visible reaction is seen. If the visible reaction begins at 199, the President may have been struck as early as 163; if the visible reaction begins at 204-06, he may have been struck as early as 168-170; if the visible reaction begins while the President is behind the sign, he may have been struck as early as 179-188. 


              (e) The velocity of the first bullet would have been little diminished by its passage through the President. Therefore, if Governor Connally was in the path of the bullet it would have struck him and (probably) caused the wounds he sustained in his chest cavity.  Strong indications that this occurred are provided by the facts that (1) the bullet recovered from Governor Connally's stretcher does not appear to have penetrated a wrist and (2) if the first bullet did not hit Governor Connally, it should have ripped up the car, but apparently did not.  Since the bullet recovered from the Governor's stretcher does not appear to have penetrated a wrist, if he was hit by this (the first) bullet, he was probably also hit by the second bullet. 


              (f) If Governor Connally was hit by both the first and second bullets, it is impossible to say definitively at what point, or by what point, he had been hit by the second bullet. 


              (g) Governor Connally seems to straighten up at frames 224-26, and may be reacting to a wound at this point. (If so, it would be a wound from the first bullet.)


              (h) Governor Connally seems to begin showing an expression of anguish around 242.  If he was hit with two bullets, this expression may have resulted from the second wound. 


               (i) After Governor Connally straightened up at frames 224-26 he starts a turn to the right.  As a result of this turn, at no time after frame 236 was Governor Connally in a position such that a bullet fired from the probable

site of the assassin would have caused the wound in the chest cavity which Governor Connally sustained--that is, after frame 236, the Governor presented a side view to the assassin rather than a back view.*


(j) It is not possible to say whether prior to 236 Governor Connally was ever in a position such that one bullet could have caused the five wounds he sustained. 


(k) As in the case of the President, Governor Connally could have conceivably been hit two seconds before he begins to react, but the maximum likely time interval between hit and reaction is one second, and the reaction may have been instantaneous.  The likelihood of an instantaneous reaction is particularly great in regard to the wrist wound, since pain is usually felt more quickly in a limb than in the torso.

                            Mr. Specter disagrees with this, and feels the Governor was in position to receive the chest wound up to 242.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD


FROM:       Melvin A. Eisenberg 


SUBJECT: Conference of April 21, 1964, to determine which frames in the Zapruder movies show [[underlined]] the impact of the first and second bullets. [[underlined]]






On Tuesday, April 21, 1964, a conference was held to determine which frames in the Zapruder film portray the instants at which the first and second bullets struck. 


Present were:  Dr. F. W. Light, Jr., Deputy Chief of the Biophysics Division and Chief of the Wound Assessment Branch of the Biophysics Division at Edgewood Arsenal, Maryland; Dr. Olivier, Chief of Wound Ballistics Branch of the Biophysics Division at Edgewood Arsenal, Maryland; Dr. Joseph Dolce, Consultant to the Biophysics Division at Edgewood Arsenal; Dr. Charles F. Gregory and Dr. Robert Shaw of Parkland Hospital, Dallas, Texas; Messrs. Gauthier, Shaneyfelt, and one other unidentified agent of the FBI; and Messrs. Redlich, Specter, Belin and Eisenberg.  Later in the proceedings, Governor and Mrs. Connally, Mr. Rankin and Mr. McCloy joined the conference. 


A screening was held of the Zapruder film and of slides prepared by LIFE from the film.  Each slide corresponded with a separate frame of film, beginning with frame 171. The consensus of the meeting was as follows: 


(a) The President had been definitely hit by frames 224-25 when he emerges from behind a sign with his hands clutching at his throat. 


(b) After Governor Connally straightened up at frames 224-26 he starts a turn to the right.  As a result of this turn, at no time after frame 236 was Governor Connally in a position such that a bullet fired from the probable site of the assassin would have caused the wound in the chest cavity which Governor Connally sustained--that is, after frame 236 the Governor presented a side view to the assassin rather than a back view.

(c) In many frames up to 250, the Governor's wrist is held in a position which exposed him to the type of wrist wounds he actually received. 


(d) After viewing the films and slides, the Governor was of the opinion that he had been hit by frame 231. 


(e) The Governor stated that after being hit, he looked to his right, looked to his left and then turned to his right.  He felt the President might have been hit by frame 190.  He heard only two shots and felt sure that the shots he heard were the first and third shots.  He is positive that he was hit after he heard the first shot, i.e., by the second shot, and by that shot only. 


In a discussion after the conference Drs. Light and Dolce expressed themselves as being very strongly of the opinion that Connally had been hit by two different bullets, principally on the ground that the bullet recovered from Connally's stretcher could not have broken his radius without having suffered more distortion.  Dr. Olivier withheld a conclusion until he has had the opportunity to make tests on animal tissue and bone with the actual rifle.
