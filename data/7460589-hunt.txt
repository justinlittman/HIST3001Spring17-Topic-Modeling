                The President arrived at the Emergency Room at 12:43 P.M., the 22nd of November, 1963. He was in the back seat of his limousine. Governor Connally of Texas was also in this car. The first physician to see the President was [(Dr. James Carrico, a Resident in General Surgery.
 
                Dr. Carrico noted the President to have slow, agonal respiratory efforts. He could hear a heartbeat but found no pulse or blood pressure to be present. Two external wounds, one in the lower third of the anterior neck, and the other in the occipital region of the skull, were noted. Through the head wound, blood and brain were extruding. Dr. Carrico inserted a cuffed endotracheal tube. While doing so, he noted a ragged wound of the trachea immediately below the larynx.
 
                At this time, Dr. Malcom Perry, Attending Surgeon, Dr. Charles Baxter, Attending Surgeon, and Dr. Ronald Jones, another Resident in General Surgery, arrived. Immediately thereafter, Dr. M. T. Jenkins, Director of the Department of Anesthesia, and Doctors Giesecke and Hunt, two other Staff Anesthesiologists, arrived. The endotracheal tube had been connected to a Bennet respirator to assist the President’s breathing. An Anesthesia machine was substituted for this by Dr. Jenkins. Only 100% oxygen was administered.
 
A cutdown was performed in the right ankle, and a polyethylene catheter inserted in the vein. An infusion of lactated Pinger’s solution was begun. Blood was drawn for type and crossmatch, but unmatched type “O” RH negative blood was immediately obtained and begun. Hydrocortisone 300 mgms was added to the intravenous fluids.
 
Dr. Robert McClelland, Attending Surgeon arrived to help in the President’s care. Doctors Perry, Baxter, and McClelland began a tracheostomy, as considerable quantities of blood were present from the President’s oral pharynx. At this time, Dr. Paul Peters, Attending Urological Surgeon, and Dr. Kemp Clark, Director of Neurological Surgery, arrived. Because of the lacerated

Trachea, anterior chest tubes were placed in both pleural spaces. These were connected to sealed underwater drainage.
 
Neurological examination revealed the President’s pupils to be widely dilated and fixed to light. His eyes were divergent, being deviated outward; a skew deviation from the horizontal was present. No deep tendon reflexes or spontaneous movements were found.
 
There was a large wound in the right occipitoparietal region, from which profuse bleeding was occurring. 1500 cc. of blood were estimated on the drapes and floor of the Emergency Operating Room. There was considerable loss of scalp and bone tissue. Both cerebral and cerebellar tissue were extruding from the wound.
 
Further examination was not possible as cardiac arrest occurred at this point. Closed chest cardiac massage was begun by Dr. Clark. A pulse palpable in both the carotid and femoral arteries was obtained. Dr. Perry relieved on the cardiac massage while a cardiotachioscope was connected. Dr. Fouad Bashour, Attending Physician, arrived as this was being connected. There was electrical silence of the President’s heart.
 
President Kennedy was pronounced dead at 1300 hours by Dr. Clark.

Subject:                                       Statement concerning resuscitative efforts for President John F. Kennedy
 
Upon receiving a stat alarm that this distinguished patient was being brought to the emergency room at Parkland Memorial Hospital, I dispatched [Doctors A.H. Giesecke/underlined and checked with pencil] and [Jackie H. Hunt/underlined with red pen and checked with pencik] with an anesthesia machine and resuscitative equipment to the major surgical emergency room area, and I ran down the stairs. On my arrival in the emergency operating room at approximately 1230 I found that [Doctors Carrico/underlined and checked with pencil] and/or [Delaney/underlined and checked with pencil] had begun resuscitative efforts by introducing an orotracheal tube, connecting it for controlled ventilation to a Bennet intermittent positive pressure breathing apparatus. [Doctors Charles Baxter, Malcom Perry, and Robert McClelland/underlined and checked with pencil] arrived at the same time and began the tracheostomy and started the insertion of a right chest tube, since there was also obvious tracheal and chest damage. [Doctors Paul Peters and Kemp Clark/underlined and checked with pencil] arrived simultaneously and immediately thereafter assisted respectively with the insertion of the right chest tube and with manual closed chest cardiac compression to assure circulation.
 
For better control of artificial ventilation, I exchanged the intermittent positive pressure breathing apparatus for an anesthesia machine and continued artificial ventilation. Doctors [Gene Akin/underlined with pencil] and A.H. Giesecke assisted with the respiratory problems incident to changing from the orotracheal tube to a tracheostomy tube, and Doctors Hunt and Giesecke connected a cardioscope to determine cardiac activity.
 
During the progress of these activities, the emergency room cart was elevated at the foot in order to provide a Trendelenburg position, a venous cutdown was performed on the right saphenous vein, and additional fluids were begun in a vein in the left forearm while blood was ordered from the blood bank. All of these activities were completed by approximately 1245, at which time external cardiac massage was still being carried out effectively by Doctor Clark as judged by a palpable peripheral pulse. Despite these measures there was no electrocardiographic evidence of cardiac activity.

2- Statement concerning resuscitative [efforts for President John F. Kennedy/underlined with pen]
 
there described resuscitative activities were indicated as of first importance, and after they were carried out “tention was turned to all other evidences of injury. There was a great laceration on the right side of the head (temporal and occipital), causing a great defect in the skull plate so that there was herniation and laceration of great area of the brain, even to the extent that the cerebellum had protruded from the wound. There were also fragmented sections of brain on the drapes of the emergency room cart. With the institution of adequate cardiac compression, there was a great flow of blood from the cranial cavity, indicating that there was much vascular damage as well as brain tissue damage.
 
It is my personal feeling that all methods of resuscitation were instituted expeditiously and efficiently. However, this cranial and intracranial damage was of such magnitude as to cause the irreversible damage. President Kennedy was pronounced dead at 1300.
