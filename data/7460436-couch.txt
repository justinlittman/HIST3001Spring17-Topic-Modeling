[left of Page] MEMORANDUM 
To: Messrs. Redlich and Craig 
From: Joseph A. Ball and David W. Bolin 
Subject: Testimony before the Commission of Eyewitness Testimony-- 
Norman Redlich Memo of March 9 
In reviewing the March 9 memorandum from Norman Redlich 
on the above subject, we believe the record should show the following: 
[indent] 1. In Ball-Belin report no. 1, on page 235, it was 
recommended that among the eyewitnesses to the rifle in the TSBD
Building, only Messrs. Brennan and Jackson should be called before 
the Commission and the remaining witnesses should have their testi-
mony recorded by deposition. We believe that the minimum number 
of witnesses should be called before the Commission in order to 
conserve the time of the Commission members; since the transcripts would 
be available from the depositions, there would be no need at this 
time to call the what in substance was corroborating testimony ancillary 
to that of the main witnesses. If depositions produce important new
facts, the Commission could always call such witnesses at a later date. 
[indent] 2. We take exception to the alleged facts and the 
implications of the second sentence in the March 9 Redlich memo-
randum whereby it is asserted that Robert Edwards and Ronald Fisher.

[Page 3]
"of all the eyewitnesses they have been the least definite in their 
willingness to say that Oswald was the person who fired the rifle. 
Why should they not be questioned on April 6 at the sam time as you 
question Brennan?" he implication is that they are not being called
because they have been the least definite in their willingness to 
identify Oswald as the assassin. 
[indent] To begin with, the fact is that eyewitnesses Euins,
Worrell, and Rowland ar ebeing called pursuant to the request of 
Mr. Spector is to call all eyewitnesses [underlined] who saw a rifle. 
Spector is not concerned with who fired the rifle -- his sole concern 
is the place from which the shots were fired. Edwards and Fisher 
saw no rifle; they were not looking at the TSBD Building at the time 
the shots were fired. 
[indent] Of the witnesses other than Brennan, Jackson saw only
a rifle and could not possibly identify Oswald. Euins only says he saw
a white man with no hat and had a bald spot on his head and did not see
the assassin's face and could not identify him. Worrell at the time 
of the shooting just saw a gun barrel and only purports to identify 
someone who looked like Oswald after he had run about 100 yards away
from the building when he looked back and saw someone else running 
away form the building when he looked back and saw someone else running
away from the building -- obviously, this is poor identification. 


[Page 4] 
Rowland identified the person only as a white man with a light colored
shirt on open at the neck and of slender build and dark but could 
not identify the person as Oswald. Thus, it could hardly be said that 
Euins and Jackson are "definite in their willingness to say that Oswald
was the person who fired the rifle." And even though Worrell is 
willing to identify Oswald as the person he saw running away, as 
fact-finders we give little weight to his testimony in light of his 
limited basis for identification. Moreover, he saw no one firing the 
rifle -- all he saw was a rifle. 
[indent] On the other hand, Robert Edwards in an affidavit
said the man he saw in the window had on a light colored sport shirt
with rather short hair and was around 26 years old, and Ronald Fisher 
in an affidavit stated that the man was light headed and had an open 
neck shirt and was in his twenties with a clear complexion. When 
interviewed by officers of the Dallas Police Department, Fisher said 
pictured of Oswald looked like the man he saw but he declined definite
identification. When later interviewed by the FBI, neither Fisher 
nor Edwards could identify the man from pictures. Edwards identified 
the person as having sandy hair and Fisher said the man had light 
hair. It is identification of hair color which would not integrate 
with Oswald's appearance, although it might be explained by 
reflection of sunlight if this is the same person. Certainly we intend 


[Page 5] 
in depositions to go into this area. (We might add that a collateral 
witness to the Tippit murder, William Arthur Smith, said that when 
he first saw Oswald on TV he did not think Oswald was the person
who shot Tippit, for on TV it looked as if Oswald had light colored 
hair whereas the individual Smith observed had dark hair.) 
[indent] We did state to Mr. Spector that if he wanted to call 
Euins, Worrell and Rowland to get all the witnesses who claimed 
they saw a rifle, we had no objection, although we felt it not necessary
since depositions would be available to Commission members. 
(Spector agreed it was not necessary to call Couch who rode in the 
same car with Jackson and who corroborates Jackson's exclamation 
about a gun and who also says he saw a gun being withdrawn.) Just 
as we had no objections to Spector's request to call Euins, Worrell 
and Rowland, we similarly have no objection to calling Fisher and 
Edwards, although again we feel that deposition transcripts would 
be adequate and that at this time it is unnecessary to have them as
Commission witnesses. If on deposition these two witnesses testify 
to facts which warrant additional interrogation in front of the 
Commission, they can and should be called at a later date.
