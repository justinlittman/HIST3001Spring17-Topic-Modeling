On November 25, 1963, Mr. C. J. PRICE, Administrator, Parkland Memorial Hospital, Dallas, Texas, advised that the Death Certificate and Statements of Medical Treatment relating to President JOHN F. KENNEDY had been taken by GEORGE G. BURKLEY, MD, White House, Washington, D.C., and Secrete Service Agents. Mr. PRICE stated, however, that a summary had been prepared by Dr. KEMP CLARK, Director, Service of Neurological Surgery at the request of GEORGE G. BURKLEY, MD, and was transmitted to Dr. BURKLEY by letter dated November 23, 1963.


        Mr. PRICE made available reproduced copies of the summary and letter furnished Dr. BERKLEY.


        The following are the contents of the summary prepared by Dr. KEMP CLARK, verbatim:


Summary


“The President arrived at the Emergency Room at 12:43 P.M., the 22nd of November, 1963. He was in the back seat of his limousine. Governor Connally of Texas was also in this car. The first physician to see the President was Dr. James Carrico, a Resident in General Surgery.


“Dr. Carrico noted the President to have slow, agonal respiratory efforts. He could hear a heartbeat but found no pulse or blood pressure to be present. Two external wounds, one in the lower third of the anterior neck, the other in the occipital region of the skull, were noted. Through the head wound, blood and brain were extruding. Dr. Carrico inserted a cuffed endotracheal tube. While doing so, he noted a ragged wound of the trachea immediately below the larynx.


“At this time, Dr. Malcolm Perry, Attending Surgeon, Dr. Charles Baxter, Attending Surgeon, and Dr. Ronald Jones, another Resident in General Surgery, arrived. Immediately thereafter, Dr. M.T. Jenkins, Director of the Department of Anesthesia and Doctors Giesecke and Hunt, two other Staff Anesthesiologists, arrived. The endotracheal tube had been connected to a

“Bennett respirator to assist the President’s breathing. An anesthesia machine was substituted for this by Dr. Jenkins. Only 100% oxygen was administered.


“A cutdown was performed in the right ankle, and a polyethylene catheter inserted in the vein. An infusion of lactated Ringer’s solution was begun. Blood was drawn for type and crossmatch, but unmatched type ‘O’ RH negative blood was immediately obtained and begun. Hydrocortisone 300 mgs was added to the intravenous fluids.


        "Dr. Robert McClelland, Attending Surgeon, arrived to help in the President's care. Doctors Perry, Baxter, and McClelland began a tracheostomy, as considerable quantities of blood were present from the President's oral pharynx. At this time, Dr. Paul Peters, Attending Urological Surgeon, and Dr. Kemp Clark, Director of Neurological Surgery, arrived. Because of the lacerated trachea, anterior chest tubes were placed in both pleural spaces. These were connected to sealed underwater drainage. 
"Neurological examination revealed the President's pupils to be widely dilated and fixed to light. His eyes were divergent, being deviated outward; a skew deviation from the horizontal was present. No deep tendon reflexes spontaneous movements were found.
"There was a large wound in the right occipitoparietal region, from which profuse bleeding was occurring. 1500 cc. of blood were estimated on the drapes and floor of the Emergency Operating Room. There was considerable loss of scalp and bone tissue. Both cerebral and cerebellar tissue were extruding from the wound. 
"Further examination was not possible as cardiac arrest occurred at this point. Closed chest cardiac massage was began by Dr. Clark. A pulse palpable in both the carotid and femoral arteries was obtained. Dr. Perry relieved on the cardiac massage while a cardiotachioscope was connected. Dr. Fouad Bashour, Attending Physician arrived as this was being connected.
