On November 27th, 1963, DONALD G TANNER, 402 Konawa Drive, Dallas, Texas , employed at K and L Service Center , 7819 Lake June Road, telephonically advised SA CARL E. UNDERHILL that he overheard a rumor a rumor that LEE HARVEY OSWALD, on a day or two before the death of President KENNEDY, had ordered a new Cadillac and he was going to inherit some money. He said he heard this at the grocery store located at the corner of Lake June Road and Jim Miller Road.
He said in his opinion, JACK RUBENSTEIN was not too patriotic and there was a connection between OSWALD and RUBENSTEIN. 
The following investigation was conducted by SAs JAMES J. WARD and ROBERT E. BASHAM on December 6, 1963: 


DONALD G. TANNER, 402 Konawa Drive, advised that he could not recall who he learned the above from, but he believed that an employee of the grocery had overheard this comment made and told the man he heard it from. He advised that he did not know JACK RUBY or LEE HARVEY OSWALD and had never seen them before. 
GROVER HUDGENS, Owner, Hudgens Grocery, 7102 Lake June Road; RICHARD HARDY, 3808 Forest Lawn, Dallas, an employee of the grocery store; and H.G. GARRET, 7920 Elam Road, Dallas, another grocery store employee, all advised that they had never overheard any rumor to the effect that LEE HARVEY OSWALD had ordered a new Cadillac and said that he was going to inherit some money. Mr. GARRETT advised, however, that he recalls a used car dealer on Lake June Road.

He said that JOHNSON repossesed this car from OSWALT about two months ago. He said that OSWALT was one of three brothers that came from Mississippi sometime back, and that he is not identical with the LEE H. OSWALD whose photograph he observed in the newspapers since the assassination of President KENNEDY. He advised that OSWALT was believed to be presnetly employed by Thomas Plating and Bumper Excange, Dallas. RAY advised he never knew LEE HARVEY OSWALD and had never seen him before. He said that Mr. JOHNSON'S telephone number was FE 1-1500.

THOMAS RAY, six miles northeast of Blossom, Texas, advised that since he has been previously interviewed he had discussed all of the information he had previously reported with his wife, and she had made every effort to recall everything she had discussed with her countrymen and LEE HARVEY OSWALD at Dallas, Texas, over the holiday weekend of December 28-30, 1962. He stated that he did not know of anything else he could furnish since, as he had previously reported , he did not enter into the conversations with the former Russian citizens had had among themselves and with LEE HARVEY OSWALD. He said, however, that during his discussion with his wife, they had agreed that the name of the couple who lived in a lavish home and were from an old pioneer Dallas family, was named JACKSON. He said he did not know the address of the JACKSONS but was sure that some of the Dallas people at the Ford party could furnish that information. RAY said that one matter that caused his wife much concern since he had talked to her was the fact that OSWALD had been so easily married in Russia, and the fact that the OSWALDS encountered no difficulty in getting out of Russia to some to the United States. He said that apparently this matter had been discussed by several Russian members at the party on the veneing of the Ford party and /at subsequent meetings during the weekend in Dallas in December, 1962. RAY explained that his wife would be able to furnish more complete information.

    Mrs. THOMAS RAY (NATALIE) was interviewed at her home approximately six miles northeast of Blossom, Texas,  but prior to the interview she was advised of the identity of SA DEL D. DRAKE, JR.


   Mrs. RAY stated that she had been born in Russia and had married her husband in 1946 in Germany, where she was a displaced person. He was a former GI who had taken a job as a civilian radio operator. She subsequently moved to her present home in Blossom, had become a naturalized American citizen and had received her papers in Federal Court, Paris, Texas. 


   Mrs. RAY  stated that in 1962, through mutual friends, Mr. and Mrs. CHARLES E. HARRIS, Georgetown, Texas, (Mrs. HARRIS is Russian born, but now an American Citizen) the RAYS were invited to attend a New Year's celebration in Dallas, Texas, at the home of Mr. and Mrs. DECLAN FORD, 14057 Brookcrest Drive, on December 28, 29, 1962. She said that they met the FORDS in Dallas; went to this party at the FORDS; and to the best of her recollection the following persons attended the party and she wished to explain that she had never met any of these people prior to the party with the exception of the HARRIS':
1. FNU JACKSON, apparently very prominent people in Dallas, who apparently were close friends of GEORGE BOUHE, and to whose home some of the people went after the party at the FORDS. (The JACKSON home was a very lavish home in a big residential district of Dallas). 


2. Mr. and Mrs. FRANK RAY, no relation to Mr. and Mrs. THOMAS RAY. (Mrs. FRANK RAY was Russian born). Mrs. THOMAS RAY has stated that this couple was apparently having marital difficulties and was supposed to have obtained a divorce. 


3. GEORGE BOUHE, a bachelor, 4740 Homer Street, Apartment O, telephone TA 7-2288, who Mrs. RAY described as a person who was very much interested in all of the Russian people keeping track of one another and giving a helping hand to one another. She said BOUHE was considered

the leader of the Social group. 


4. JOHN and ELAIN HALL - no known address and nothing more known of them.


5. TATIANA BIGGERS, apparently a divorcee, who was from somewhere around Houston, Texas. 


6. TEOFIL and ANNA MELLER, 5930 1/2 LaVista Drive, Dallas, Texas, telephone TA 3-2219. Both of these persons were apparently Russian born.


7. LYDIA DYMITRUK- apparently a single person who resided somewhere in Dallas, Texas. 


8. A Russian man and a Chinese woman, whose named are unrecalled were at the party and nothing more is known or recalled about them. These persons came together. 


9. Mr. and Mrs. DANIEL F. SULLIVAN, Lafayette, Louisiana- a divisional geologist for Continental Oil Company, telephone number 232-6998. 


Mrs. RAY estimated that there were from 15 to 25 couples at the party during the evening and the morning hours of December 29, 1962 prior to the time that some of the persons at the party went to the JACKSON residence for a drink. She stated that among the group at the FORD residence were LEE HARVEY OSWALD and his Russian wife, MARINA, who could not speak English. She said that the OSWALDS had been brought to the party by an unknown couple from Fort Worth, Texas, or at least a couple who resided somewhere close to the area where the OSWALDS were residing. She pointed out that most of the persons who were Russian born enjoyed talking to Mrs. OSWALD and that the people who did not understand Russian very well, did not pay too much attention to any of the conversation that took place. She said that her husband was one of these persons. However, LEE HARVEY OSWALD was questioned at considerable length by 


                                                                                                          CR 206 {handwritten}

different persons at the party including herself, and many questions were asked of him about his stay in Russia, his work, and whether he would like to return to Russia sometime in the future. Mrs. RAY explained that OSWALD was very proud of the fact that he spoke Russian so well and that she was amazed that he had such good command of the language. OSWALD stated that he might someday return to Russia and again Mrs. RAY said that she was amazed that OSWALD had such an understanding of the Russian Government and of the workings of the Russian Government. He did not exactly say anything that she could recall that sounded like he was advocating the Russian way of life and she was positive that he never did say anything about the Kennedy Administration, of American politics, or did OSWALD mention Cuba or CASTRO. Furthermore, the name of JACK RUBY was never mentioned. 


 Mrs. RAY said that many of the persons tried to talk a little English to Mrs. OSWALD, and OSWALD did not seem to care that his wife attempted to talk English. On many occasions when Mrs. Oswald was asked a question, OSWALD would interpret and answer the question for her; and this made some of the other Russian speaking guests quite angry because they felt that since Mrs. OSWALD was the latest arrival from Russia, she was more or less the "main attraction" at the party. OSWALD drank quite a bit and after some of the guests talked to him briefly, they would apparently get tired of him and turn their attention to his wife. However, Mrs. RAY said that she did understand Mrs. OSWALD to say that she and her husband had had no trouble getting married in Russia, and furthermore, they had no trouble getting permission to leave the country to come to the United States. This was a point that caused several of native Russians to wonder, since they knew that this does not happen in Russia. Mrs. OSWALD also pointed out to Mrs. RAY that in Russia the Russian people were more or less afraid to talk to her husband, because they did not trust him and that they did not welcome her husband, this was one of his reasons for wanting to come back to the United States. 


                                                                                                                 CR 206 {handwritten}

However, as Mrs. RAY pointed out, OSWALD said several times that he liked Russia and that he "might go back". She said that both the OSWALDS talked about Minsk, Russia, and that from what OSWALD said, he liked this location and the way things were run in Minsk. 


 Mrs. RAY recalled that when OSWALD was leaving the party he said that he did not actually want to leave, but that it was necessary since he did not have a car and that he was riding with another couple. ( This was apparently the couple who lived somewhere near OSWALD). She also recalled that OSWALD was not employed at the time of the party. 


She also recalled that OSWALD was introduced to her under a Russian name but she has not been able to recall just what that name was but in the event that she recalls it she will advise the FBI later. 


After the departure of the OSWALDS, Mrs. RAY related that GEORGE BOUHE said he had tried to help the OSWALDS and had tried to help him take care of his family but that OSWALD had done nothing to help himself. BOUHE said that when OSWALD would go somewhere to seek employment and was asked where he was last employed, he would reply, "Minsk, Russia", and then never give an explanation, and therefore he would not hear from his application. She said that BOUHE offered an explanation about OSWALD that seemed to be the consensus of opinion of several of the persons who knew him, and that was that OSWALD was a "mental case". However, on Sunday, December 30, 1962, while several of the persons from the party, and some others, all of whom Mrs. RAY cannot identify, were at the MELLER residence, OSWALD was discussed at considerable length by the Russians at the party. Mrs. RAY said that there was considerable speculation offered about the possibility that OSWALD was possibly a Russian Agent as that would explain why it had been no trouble for the OSWALDS to get married and to leave Russia for the United States. 


                                                                                                                             CR 206 {handwritten}
                                                                                                                                          162

But this theory was thrown out because OSWALD was "broke" and had "no connections in the United States, and Russia did not allow their Agents to be in this predicament in the United States. This was not like the Russian Government according to Mrs. RAY. 


Mrs. RAY also said that the thought had arisen in her mind that since the Russian people had not apparently accepted OSWALD  that he had been given an assignment in the United States by the Russian Government so that when he returned he would be accepted and that would probably explain his reason for wanting to return to Russia. However, Mrs.RAY said that after giving more consideration to OSWALD, she finally decided that he was a mental case, but she cannot get out of her mind that you cannot trust the Russian Government and that they are capable of doing anything. 


Mrs. RAY said that she felt sorry for Mrs. OSWALD at the party and since this was the only time she had ever seen her she knew that some of the others felt the same way because several had said that OSWALD really mistreated MARINA and they were trying to help her. Mrs. RAY said that GEORGE BOUHE seemed to have some very definite opinions on the OSWALD family and that she felt that he would be very glad to discuss them with the FBI. 


Mrs. RAY finally closed her remarks by saying again that she could not understand how OSWALD and his wife had so little trouble, if any. leaving Russia, and she knew that several of the other guests felt the same way about it. She also said that she was sorry that she could not recall anymore, but explained that this was the only time that she had seen these people and that much of the details had been forgotten until she saw OSWALD's picture on television at the time of his arrest in Dallas, Texas and many of the remarks made about him had come back to her. She said the FBI could talk to her anytime it was necessary.

AIR MAIL 


Mr. and Mrs. Thomas Ray 
Blossom, Texas 


Dear Mr. and Mrs. Ray:


On November 29, 1963, this Commission was established and authorized to investigate and report on all the circumstances surrounding the assassination of President Kennedy and the killing of alleged assassin, Lee Harvey Oswald. One of our staff attorneys, Wesley J. Liebeler, plans to be in Dallas on Monday, March 23, 1964. He will contact you shortly thereafter to discuss arrangements for the taking of your testimony on all aspects of the assassination and of the background of the alleged assassin of which you may have knowledge. 


For your information, I am enclosing copies of Executive Order No. 11130 creating this commission, S.J. Res.137, and the Rules of Procedure of this commission for the questioning of witnesses by members of the Commission staff. 


                                                                                                                       Sincerely, 
                                                                                                                        J. Lee Rankin 
                                                                                                                         General Counsel

Memorandum to Mr. J. LSE Rankin, General Counsel 


FROM: Howard P. Willens 


RE: Daily Report from Dallas 
       Wednesday, March 25, 1964
         
Mr. Hubert called to report that as a result of testimony of other witnesses he will need authorization for six more people. This doesn't mean that the original list is enlarged by six because they aren't using nearly as many people listed. The six additional persons are: Mr. E. Pierce, Alfred Riggs ( possibly Alfredo), John Severanee, Bill Lee Foster, Ed Kelly, and Harold R. Fugus. These people work in the Dallas Public Works Department and all are janitors with the exception of Pierce. Mr. Hubert is seeking information concerning possible routes from the upper story of the municipal building to the basement area of the jail. 


Last night depositions were taken from the following: Capt. C.R. Talbert, Sgt. J. A. Putnam, Lt. R.S. Pierce, Lt. Woodrow Wiggins, and Sgt. P. T. Dean. 


Today the following depositions were taken by the designated members of the staff:
