testimony has been authorized by Mr. Rankin.  Such individuals
have not yet been advised that the Commission is interested in taking
their testimony, although instructions have been given for the
preparation of such letters.  This memorandum will indicate which
of the witnesses clearly must be examined and will set forth the
relevant considerations concerning those witnesses as to which that
requirement is not entirely clear.


                Mrs. Mary E. Bledsoe
                Mr. and Mrs. A. C. Johnson
                Mrs. Earlene Roberts


        The testimony of the above-listed individuals should be
clearly taken since they have knowledge of Oswald's activities both
prior to and after the assassination.


        Hiram L. Conway.  Conway is the division manager of the
Leslie Welding Company, Oswald's first employer after his return
from Russia. The FBI report on Conway  indicates
that Conway has no personal knowledge of Oswald's personal life out-
side of the plant other than that which appears on his employment
application. As a result, I do not think that Conway's deposition need
be taken.


        Mrs. John G. Graves.  It appears from the FBI report on
Mrs. Graves  that she has only marginal information
about Oswald and that the taking of her testimony would probably not
be justified.


      Tommy Bargas.  Bargas is shop foreman for Leslie Welding
Company and seems to know more about Oswald's work there than
anyone else. Accordingly, his testimony should be taken, on the
basic proposition that we are going to interview at least one of Oswald's
co-employees from each of his former places of employment.

    Dennis H. Ofstein
    John Graef
    Robert L. Stovall


    These three individuals are associated with Jaggars - Chiles-
Stovall, the photographic firm for which Oswald worked from
October 1962 to May 1963. Graef seemed to be Oswald's immediate
supervisor and Ofstein was another trainee photographer who
commenced work about the same time Oswald did. I think the
testimony of both of those gentlemen should be taken. Perhaps
Mr. Stovall's testimony should also be taken so that a brief inquiry
as to the nature of any classified work done by J-C-S may be made.


         Robert Taylor
         G. E. Smith


        These gentlemen were employees of a Shell Service Station
on the corner of the Rock Island and Story Streets, Irving, Texas, in
the period around April 1963. Taylor says that he bought a rifle
from a man who he thinks was Oswald. This gas station is only six
blocks from the Paine residence in Irving. The taking of these men's
Testimony could be justified, although it does not seem absolutely
necessary at this point.


       Mr. and Mrs. Floyd Davis.  These people own and operate
the Sports Dome Gun Range in Grand Prairie, Texas, where Oswald
was alleged to have practiced with his rifle. The taking of their
testimony should be deferred until after Dr. Wood and his son have
been examined concerning their statements that they saw Oswald at
the above Gun Range. A determination of whether or not the Davises'
testimony should be taken can better be made at that time.


       Dr. Homer Wood
       Sterling Charles Wood
       Kenneth Longley


       The Woods say they saw Oswald at the above rifle range on
the afternoon of November 16, 1963, and their testimony on this
point should probably be taken.


       Mr. and Mrs. M. F. Tobias.   Tobias is the manager of the
apartment house at 602-604 Elsbeth Street, Dallas, and recalled

renting an apartment at 604 Elsbeth to Oswald on November 3, 1962.
Tobias and his wife probably should be examined since the FBI report
shows that they observed a man named "George" (probably
Do Mohrenschildt) come to Oswald's apartment. The FBI report
indicates that the FBI had an application to rent the apartment at
604 Elsbeth which they showed to Tobias when they interviewed him,
and this should be obtained before Tobias is examined.


        Cliff Roberts.  Roberts is a private detective who investigated
the attempt on General Walker's life particularly with reference to
the possible involvement with Mr. William McEwen Duff. Roberts
should probably be questioned at some point, but not until we have had
an opportunity to do a thorough background analysis of the Walker
incident.


      Roy Truly.  Messrs. Ball and Belin have a much greater
interest in Mr. Truly than we do. I do not know whether they plan
to take Mr. Truly is to appear before the Commission itself. Accordingly,
I think the taking of Mr. Truly's deposition should be postponed until
after we have conferred with Messrs. Ball and Belin.

           As I mentioned to you during our meeting last Monday,
members of the Commission staff are currently in Dallas taking the
depositions of various witnesses. I wish to confirm my invitation
to you or your representative to participate during the taking of
those depositions in the same manner in which you are currently
taking part in the presentation of evidence before the Commission.


          So that you are fully informed regarding the name of the
witnesses currently being deposed, I am attaching to this letter a
list of witnesses whose depositions to be deposed this week by Mr. Specter,
primarily doctors and other personnel of Parkland Hospital. The
second column sets forth the names of witnesses to be handled by
Messrs. Rubert and Griffin of the Commission staff, including offi-
cials of the Dallas Police Department and the Sheriff's office at
Dallas, who will be interrogated regarding the handling of Lee Harvey
Oswald on November 24, 1963. The third column lists the witnesses to
be handled by Messers. Jenner and Idebeler and includes persons of the
Dallass community familier with certain of Oswald's activities in the
months preceding the assassination. These members of the staff are
under instructions to take those depositions as expeditiously as can
be arranged.

                  I anticipate that the process of taking depositions in
Dallas will last through approximately Friday, April 10th. Next
week Mr. Hubert will remain in Dallas to interrogate witnesses

associated with Jack ruby and his activities prior to the killing
of Lee Harvey Oswald on November 24, 1963. Depositions will also
be taken next week and the following week by Messers. Ball and Belin
of the Commission staff. These attorneys will be interrogating
additional witnesses from the Dallas Police Department concerned
with the investigation of the assassination and various other Dallas
witnesses with information to supply regarding Lee Harvey Oswald's
involvement in the assassination. When I have authorised the
depositions of specific witnesses in this area, I shall supply you
with a list of the names.


            I hope that there arrangements meet with your approval.

               FLOYD GUY DAVIS, owner, Sports Drome Rifle Range,
8000 West Davis, Dallas, Texas, advised that his wife,
VIRGINIA, and he are the sole operators of this range.


                Mr. DAVIS stated that in the course of their
business, they maintain only one type of record, and that
is a business ledger which lists by days the amount of money
taken in at the range, as well as the amount of expenses
paid out with the names of the business concerns to whom
the money was paid. He stated that this ledger, or "journal",
does not contain the names of customers at the range.


                Mr. DAVIS stated that when they opened their range
for business on Saturday, October 26, 1963, they started off
keeping a guest sign-in type register wherein the shooter
signed his name and address. The purpose of this register was
to aid them in their new business so they could send a card
to those who had registered advising them of the date of
their future "turkey shoots".


                 However, many of the shooters did not desire to
sign the register for various reasons, and after November 3,
1963, they stopped maintaining such a sing-in sheet.


                  Mr. DAVIS stated that if his wife had referred to
a "journal" in her testimony to a member of the President's
Commission, she undoubtedly was referring to their business
ledger and not to a so-called guest register of shooters.


                  In regard to the "sign-in", records maintained
from October 26, 1963, to November 3, 1963, inclusive, Mr.
DAVIS produced from his desk six sheets of  12" by 81/2"
lined tablet paper and two sheets of 7" by 51/2" white
memorandum size paper on memo paper of the "F. B. McINTIRE
EQUIPMENT CO.", which he stated is the entire listing of

those customers who signed the register. He noted that this
list is not to be considered as all inclusive as many
shooters had declined to sign such a register during the time
they had maintained such a listing.


        Mr. DAVIS advised that the red "x" marks by the
names of many of the individuals listed on these sheets were
made by someone other than his wife and him, and he does not
know the meaning of the marks.


        Mr. DAVIS turned over the aforementioned sheets of
paper and advised that the President's Commission may use
them for any purpose they might desire; however, he does desire
their return to him eventually.


          Mrs. VIRGINIA PASH DAVIS, also known as VIRGINIA
LOUISE DAVIS, was interviewed in her trailer home located
at 2825 By Way, Dallas, Texas.


         Mrs. DAVIS stated that her husband, FLOYD GUY DAVIS,
and she first opened their Sports Drome Rifle Range, at 8000
West Davis, Dallas, Texas, on Saturday, October 26, 1963.


         She stated that when they first opened the range,
they had decided to have the customers sign a register, on
ordinary tablet paper, listing their home addresses. The
purpose of this was to obtain the addresses of the customers
in order for her to drop them a post card to advise them when
the range would hold a "turkey shoot". Some of the customers
did not react very kindly to signing such a register; some
refused to sing the register, and after a week or so, they
discontinued this practice of having the guests sign a
register. Mrs. DAVIS stated that this list is certainly not
to be considered as the complete listing of all individuals
who had used this rifle  range between Saturday,
October 26, 1963, and November 3, 1963; the last day a listing
was maintained.


         Mrs. DAVIS stated that the "journal" she was
referring to when interviewed by a member of the President's
Commission is actually a business-type ledger listing credit and
debits for a particular day's business. This journal contains
the identity of business expenses and the names of the business
concerns to whom money was paid, as well as listing the amount
of money taken in at the rifle range. She stated this journal
does not contain the names of any customers or shooters at the
range on a particular day.


         Mrs. DAVIS stated that she referred to the "journal"
in her deposition in her efforts to definitely pinpoint the


the date of the first "turkey shoot" held at the range. She
did not mean to imply that this "journal" contained the names
of customers at the range for a particular day in question.


          Regarding records maintained by their range, Mrs.
DAVIS stated that she and her husband maintain this "business
journal", referred to above, and for approximately one week
 had maintained the
previously referred to "sign-in" register containing the names
of the customers and their mailing addresses. They keep no
other record other than the "journal".


          Mrs. Davis viewed the six  12" by 8 1/2" lined
tablet paper sheets and the two 7" by 5 1/2" white business note
sheets on "F. B. McINTIRE EQUIPMENT CO." memorandum paper,
furnished by her husband on September 3, 1963, and advised
that these eight pieces of paper are the entire "sign- in"
register maintained previously at the range from October 26,
1963, and which they discontinued keeping after November 3,
1963. Mrs. DAVIS stated that the President's Commission is
most welcome to use these papers for any purpose they see fit,
She notes that the red "x" marks by various individuals'
names were made by some other Government agency, and the meaning
of the check marks are unknown to her.


     Mrs. DAVIS stated that her husband and she need their
business journal in the course of their business, but if the
Commission still desires the use of the same (after now understanding
the true nature of this ledger), she can possibly make it
available to them.


      Mr. BUELL WESLEY FRAZIER, 1413 Shady Grove,
Apartment 27, Irving, Texas, employed at Texas School
Book Depository, advised that on no occasion did he
ever take LEE HARVEY OSWALD to a rifle range. He
advised that he did not take OSWALD to the Sports Drome
Rifle Range, Dallas, Texas, on either November 10, or 17,
1963, or on any other date.

        The President's Commission on the Assassination
of the President KENNEDY by letter dated August 28, 1964,
requested the recontact of Mrs. VIRGINIA LOUISE DAVIS,
2225 By Way, Dallas, Texas, who, with her husband, operates
the Sports Drome Rifle Range in Dallas.


        The Commission noted that Mrs. DAVIS was
originally interviewed by Special Agents of the Federal
Bureau of Investigation on December 1, 1963, at which time
she apparently indicated that no written "register" was
maintained at the rifle range during the period from
September to November, 1963, when OSWALD is alleged to have
practiced at the rifle range.


        The Commission further noted that in the course of
her deposition to a member of the President's Commission on
April 1, 1964, Mrs. DAVIS referred to a "journal", which she
described as a daily record she kept of everything that
happens at the range, which everyone had to sign when they
first opened the range. She noted that the Federal Bureau of
Investigation had picked up the sign-in slips and checked them
out.
